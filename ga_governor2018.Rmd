The 2018 Georgia governor race between Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp was notable not only for how close Democrats were to flipping a long-held Republican state (48.8% to 50.2%), but also for widespread reports of voter suppression. 

In the lead-up to the election, then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp oversaw the closure of about 8% of local voting precincts and the removal of nearly 100,000 names from the voter registry because of Georgia's "use it or lose it" bill. These actions led to allegations of [voter suppression](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/27/us/elections/georgia-voters-purge.html), as the purge was seen as [unjustly targeting black and low-income voters](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/us/politics/georgia-voter-suppression.html?searchResultPosition=2). 

Nationally the 2018 midterms were defined by a [few notable trends](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-2018-midterms-in-4-charts/):
 
* [Democratic gains in the suburbs](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-suburbs-all-kinds-of-suburbs-delivered-the-house-to-democrats/)
* Unprecedented levels of voter turnout (Georgia featured an estimated 55% turnout, for example)
* A surge of newly-elected -- and female -- representatives 

Turning to the 2020 election, there is some suggestion that Georgia could be [close to a swing state](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/20/politics/georgia-democrats-2020-election/index.html). There are an extraordinary number of variables that might affect whether Democrats can flip Georgia seats in nearly every race, but it is likely that they will have to both consolidate (i.e. the 6th District) and expand upon gains from the 2018 midterms.

This project is just an introductory look at some of the 2018 governor race results, as well as a look at demographic trends in Georgia that could be relevant in 2020 and beyond. Data is largely from the tidycensus package, which includes the 2017 American Community Survey (ACS) results used here. Election data is from the Georgia Secretary of State website.

First we can load all of the packages we'll need. 
```{r warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidycensus)
library(tigris)
library(sf)
library(viridis)
library(ggthemes)
library(ggsflabel)

```

# Data
The following code joins multiple election and ACS demographic datasets together by county (the geographic level of detail provided by the GA SoS election results). It combines (1) educational attainment data (specifically the estimated percentage of residents with a college degree -- likely the primary predictor of voting for Donald Trump in 2016), (2) 2018 general election Georgia voter turnout by demographic group, (3) 2018 general election governor race results, and (4) the percentage of wealthy voters by county (annual incomes > $200k). 

Of note, our first ACS data download from the Tidycensus package includes the "geometry = TRUE" option, which allows us to conveniently download SF geometries for the geography of interest (counties) in Georgia.

```{r warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
ga_edu <- get_acs(state = "GA",
                  geography = "county",
                  variables = c("B23006_023", "B23006_001"),
                  geometry = TRUE) 

ga_wealthy <- get_acs(state = "GA",
                     geography = "county",
                     variables = c("B19001_017", "B19001_001"),
                     geometry = TRUE)

```

```{r warning = FALSE}
## educational attainment - tidycensus
ga_edu2 <- ga_edu %>%
    mutate(type = if_else(variable == "B23006_001", "total population", "college degree")) %>%
    group_by(GEOID) %>%
    mutate(per_college = estimate[type == "college degree"] / estimate[type == "total population"],
           NAME = str_to_lower(str_extract(NAME, ".+(?=\\sCounty, Georgia)"))) %>%
    filter(type == "college degree")

## Add in turnout data - from the GA SoS website
ga_turnout <- read_csv("ga_county_turnout.csv")

ga_turnout <- ga_turnout %>%
    mutate(county_name = str_to_lower(county_name))

ga_edu_election <- ga_edu2 %>%
    left_join(ga_turnout, by = c("NAME" = "county_name"))

## Add in voting data - from the GA SoS website
gov_votes <- read_csv("gov_votes.csv") %>%
    mutate(County = str_to_lower(County),
           winner = if_else(total_votes_abrams > total_votes_kemp, "abrams", "kemp"),
           election_year = 2018)

gov_2014 <- read_csv("gov_2014.csv") %>%
    mutate(county = str_to_lower(county),
           per_carter = carter_votes / total)

gov_votes <- gov_votes %>%
    left_join(gov_2014, by = c("County" = "county")) %>%
    mutate(per_abrams = total_votes_abrams / total_votes,
           winner_18 = winner,
           winner_14 = if_else(carter_votes > deal_votes, "carter", "deal"),
           dem_dif = per_abrams - per_carter
    )

gov_votes <- gov_votes %>%
    select(County, 13:17)

ga_edu_election <- ga_edu_election %>%
    left_join(gov_votes, by = c("NAME" = "County"))

## add in wealthy voters - tidycensus
ga_wealthy <- ga_wealthy %>%
    mutate(type = if_else(variable == "B19001_001", "all voters", "over $200k")) %>%
    group_by(GEOID) %>%
    mutate(per_wealthy = estimate[type == "over $200k"] / estimate[type == "all voters"],
           NAME = str_to_lower(str_extract(NAME, ".+(?=\\sCounty, Georgia)"))) %>%
    filter(type == "over $200k")

ga_wealthy_select <- ga_wealthy %>%
    select(GEOID, NAME, per_wealthy) 

st_geometry(ga_wealthy_select) <- NULL

ga_wealthy_select <- as_tibble(ga_wealthy_select)

ga_edu_election2 <- ga_edu_election %>%
    left_join(ga_wealthy_select, by = c("NAME", "GEOID")) %>%
    mutate(flip_dets = if_else(winner_14 == "carter" & winner_18 == "abrams", "DEM to DEM",
                        if_else(winner_14 == "deal" & winner_18 == "abrams", "REP to DEM",
                          if_else(winner_14 == "carter" & winner_18 == "kemp", "DEM to REP",
                                  if_else(winner_14 == "deal" & winner_18 == "kemp", "REP to REP",
                                          "other")))))

```

# Maps 
Next we can make some maps based on the dataset above. This is just an introductory look at both the results and the demographic trends. In the future we can look more deeply into turnout by demographic groups, how education and income levels affected turnout and voting preferences, and more. 

This section is inspired in part by [Jason Timm's work on New Mexico politics](https://www.jtimm.net/2019/01/17/xochitl-torres-small-win-2018/). 

As we can see below, Stacey Abrams notably flipped two Atlanta suburban counties -- Cobb and Gwinnett. Analyzing their demographic makeups and turnout (and comparing them with Democratically-flipped districts country-wide) would be very interesting for a follow-up post. However, there were several middle-Georgia counties that flipped from Democrat-to-Republican, including Washington, Wilkinson, and Burke, among others. 

The chart comparing the actual democrat percentages by county between Carter (2014) and Abrams reinforce how she overperformed 2014 particularly surrounding Atlanta. 

```{r warning = FALSE}

# Atlanta only
The final view is a look at Atlanta counties that flipped.
```{r}

                      "cobb", "clayton", "coweta",
                      "douglas", "fayette", "henry")


atl_edu <- ga_edu_election2 %>%
    filter(NAME %in% atlanta_counties)

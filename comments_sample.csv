Keifer, in slightly over 24 hours you have made 50 contributions. Almost all of them related to the latest Malleus farrago, and you have kept up that sort of pace for days. You've commented on numerous talk pages and reiterated yourself on numerous occasions. It is much more than merely responding, and in so far as it is responding the volume may reflect the sheer number of fronts that you are trying to cover. I mentioned """"less haste, more speed"""" above, but another saying that might be apt is """"less is more"""".What you do and how you do it is entirely your affair, of course, but one thing I've noticed is that Malleus seems rarely to respond directly to the many posts that you make at his own talk page. There may be some conclusions to be drawn from that. Demiurge's point regarding MONGO may have some validity, also. Certainly, both of you are going at it hammer-and-tongs and, as much as I do not like the current situation at Arbcom, it is reaching the point where I for one am tending not to bother reading many of the messages posted by you both: frankly, they've become boring and repetitive. That is the nature of propaganda, not debate.   """

 I think we should respect the data collected by Yugoslav Statistical offices. It makes no sense and would be POV if we start redefining the nationality of people. During the communist era many Serbs (as did many Albanian too) chose to leave Kosovo because Central Serbia was more developed, both economically and culturally. Many Serbs (and Albanians)who wanted to study had to move to for example Belgrade and did never come back, this happened all over Europe, and not just in Kosovo. People moved from rural areas cities and for many Serbs is was natural to study in Serbia (Kosovo did not have a university until 60s). Maybe some Serbs left Kosovo because they did not want to live in an area dominated by Albanians but it is more likely Serbs left Kosovo because of economy and education than Albanians. You are saying more than 400 000 Serbs lived in Kosovo before the 1999 war. I don`t believe this and even Serbian government have not said something like this. 400 000 is 25 % of the population and we all know Albanians in 1991 had 82 % of the population(100- 25 = 75 % Albanians + other minorities??).

'Nuff said. Or perhaps not. Here's a tidbit from that last WS """"Trivia"""" section linked above:

 According to Tug McGraw, one of the police horses, who lined up in the field during the 9th inning of Game 6, was not """"stadium trained."""" (8th item down the list)

I don't think you can top (or is it bottom?) that for trivia. There's a simple reason that over a quarter of a century of trivia sections (and probably more) have piled up in these World Series articles: Writing well is hard work. It's just too easy to simply drop minutiae onto these pages and file them under """"Trivia"""" and let somebody else do the hard work of integrating them . . . later. 

Part of my motivation for dredging up all those links above is that I've noticed an inconsistency of style and layout, and some confusing or redundant info in all the WS articles going back to 1903. It's like the same car built by different contractors at different times with different materials. I find it a bit troubling because it's a sign of limited effort, limited means for anybody to have developed a plan for what could be a real highlight of WP (can you say """"Fall Classic Portal""""?). I found it fairly easy to take the '06 trivia about La Russa and Leyland and create a separate section under the """"Background"""" section, and it seems to have held up since Friday night. But it took some time to sift through it and move the info.

Cutting to the chase: All this WS """"Trivia"""" is classifiable. The better it's organized, the less it will seem like trivia, so if a handful of """"labels"""" could be cooked up for categories of info formerly known as trivia, the overall style of these articles will seem to read better. That ought to settle the trivia issue.

Postscript: For instance, a 4-1 WS where one contender splits """"on the road"""" and then comes home and sweeps to win 3 more and clinch is fairly rare from what I've looked up so far. What the Cards have done against Detroit in 2006 matches what NY (NL) accomplished in 1969 (except the Mets dropped Game 1 instead of 2 to Baltimore). I'm still working my way thru past Fall Classics to see when else this happened, so I can add this info to the '06 article in an appropriate place, but not as an addition to the dreaded Trivia section. A heading that might be appropriate for this info each and every year: Long series, short series. 4 or 5 games would classified as a short series, 6 or 7 classified as long. Easy to spot trends in this area and develop copy to fill a section like this. Was a short or long series predicted each year; by who; was a trend broken, were the prognosticators wrong, did a noted BB writer point this out so it doesn't smack of the dreaded Original Research? Now really 'nuff said.   (talk)  """

Bias because America has a big and busy railway- India has a world rebound railway, witch is both an example of big and busy! As for the non-stop life of the Japanese, German and British railways!

Noting the un-note-worthy- I literally copied the Wikipedia article in to a map, so that also goes back to say, that if anything, the article needs a good tidy up.

To may variables to decipher- Were they indirectly questioning the whole article’s itegraty, since the map was only a literal coppy of the on-screen text.

 AndyTheGrump, Is THE REFERENCED AND PUBLISHED Decision of EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECtHR) not a PUBLISHED RELIABLE Source? Notice that I am giving the ECtHR reference DIRECTLY from OFFICIAL ECtHR website. 212.174.38.3   

 European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event 
This must be added to the article:
On 17 December 2013, (the case: Perinçek v. Switzerland (application no. 27510/08)) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide. Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""").

I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915.
Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey.
However, Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached. 212.174.38.3

That is why the discussion of 1915 Events cannot be continued objectively. One of the sides (Armenians) do not want to hear any counter thoughts let alone to see a counter writing in such a FREE Wikipedia environment! 212.174.38.3

The infamous referendum

Let me explain, since you're not Maltese. 

The """"yes"""" votes did in fact surpass the """"no"""" votes slightly, but despite that, less than 50% of the total voting population actually voted """"yes."""" Therefore, the Nationalist party celebrated because the """"yes"""" votes surpassed the """"no"""" votes, and concurrently, the Labour Party celebrated because less than 50% of the population voted """"yes."""" (Can you imagine what it was like? Carcades from both parties, mass meetings...both claiming that """"WE WON!""""? Seriously...)

Therefore there was complete chaos in Malta for a few weeks because nobody could figure out whether we were actually going to join the EU or not. Finally, the Primeminister was eventually forced to hold an early general election to clear the misunderstandings. 

Quotes from the letter:

""""The Christian Democrats [Nationalists], now in power, are assured of a coming election victory. They are also in for a resounding defeat in a referendum on Malta's European membership.""""

""""There should be an amalgamation of Election and Referendum. The Nationalists should say; """"ok, we are going to have a referendum on Europe; this coming election will serve also as a referendum on Europe""""."""" [ This is what the Nationalist party was forced to do]

Now, obviously, the Nationalists still claim that they won the referendum, while Labour still claim the opposite. But the point is, an early general election was held due to this. In other words (it's hilarious really), the referendum was utterly futile. Our entry in the EU was in fact determined by a general election!

Now that you know what happened, perhaps you could reword that phrase or something...whatever you thing is right...

 Okay, then let's turn it around: I don't know what your professional background is, but let's say you are contributing to an article fully in line with your profession, and you'll literally see dozens of users engaging in edit wars reverting not only your own edits, but also well-informed edits made by others - all this going on for a couple of days. That's exactly when you guys (i.e. ADMINS) you should have a careful look: I'm not the problem, at most I am a symptom of it, because I was trying to be part of the solution by pointing out the aforementioned issues. The quality fluctations of that particular article have been severe, it seems that there's a huge mess of people editing without any relevant background knowledge whatsoever. This has nothing to do with elitism: wikipedia (or any encyclopedia) cannot just thrive through people without any domain expertise. And other users have been highlighting these issues, too - but were ignored because their criticism also affected wp admins. Really, you cannot expect high quality articles if the people """"writing"""" it are merely acting like robots adding refs to articles that they don't understand, let alone briefings that they never watched in the first place. Regarding the term jackass, just look at the Jackass article, it describes fairly well what's going on there, just because there's huge public interest in the event, which attracts countless people who don't even bother getting informed in the first place, and rather prefer edit warring instead. BTW: I am not trying to talk common-sense to you, like I said: I don't care about this account and/or IP being blocked or not - not even if it should not be temporary.

Thanks for your compliments. I don't remember much more about Admiral Makarov than what I wrote in the stub. I agree with the need of consistency in transliteration. I think, however, that when some Russian term is already established in English, the established transliteration should take precedence of the letter by letter rule. My impression (not confirmed though a thorough search though) is that Kniaz iz a more common English usage of the Russian word Князь. However, the google counts for kniaz and knyaz are close enough, so my impression is rather subjective. Also, the article you refered me to gives two choices for transliteration of Великий as both Velikiy"""" or Veliky''. The former term seems better to me, but again this is rather subjective.

When I begged several of these people (who hate each other) who have vital collections of one of a kind books, documents, photos, articles, etc to look at what I had written and to edit it, they """"saw/experienced"""" a """"googleesque"""" one way portal; then, the one man who had the courage to click edit looked, blinked, read, stopped, called me and said, """"You claim it's so easy a dog could do it. If it's so easy then have Remsen edit it."""" He hung up.

This is not an """"issue"""" that can be fixed anytime soon; however, Remsen will keep working on it.

As for my """"serious"""" issue, I just got a nice note from Wesley Northrop resolving it:

Pete Bertine and Remsen are impressed and thrilled with this experience, gold stars to everyone. We are now more determined than ever to get an 89 year old curmudgeon to contribute to Wikipedia.

 New Reversion War 

Hi,
I don't know whether you've been keeping up with the Race article or not. Somebody put some unrepresentative pictures up and labeled them as members of various [races]. That addition was reverted by Peak, and several more reversions have occurred without any discussion other than in the edit summaries.

After checking the photo credits I added the following caption to the photo to try to properly contextualize them: 

Fugitives categorized by the FBI into different """"races"""". From left to right: White, Black, Hispanic Mestizo, Asian. Top row males, bottom row females.Does asserting a racial identity give any more information than is contained in the photographs? See the discussion below.

The original pictures were a nasty practical joke, I think, but Sam Spade likes them, and several other people have aided him in his reversions. I don't want another edit war, so I am hoping that you will watch developments and, if you agree that my way is a compromise that will not propagate disinformation, you will perhaps freeze the page in my version until the combattants come to the bargaining table.

English cuisine, Cantonese cuisine, Vietnamese cuisine, etc.). I agree that there should be a separate article for the cuisine of ethnic Hawaiians, but the other article should not be about colonial Hawaiian cuisine; it should be called Cuisine of Hawaii and be about the cuisine of the island of Hawaii, documenting all the cuisines found there, including ethnic Hawaiian cuisine. It will not be a parent article for the ethnic Hawaiian cuisine article because that article will include the introduction of Hawaiian cuisine into other regions of the world. 2) The name of the article about the cuisine of ethnic Hawaiians should remain at Hawaiian cuisine, not be moved to Native Hawaiian cuisine.

Peacock words

WP:PEACOCK lays it out pretty clearly, and specifically mentions """"famous"""" as a word to avoid.  But people seem to wish to use this word, in one particular place only, in this article.  The logic behind avoiding the word is very clear: it's subjective, and described what people might think about something rather than any objective fact about it.  What is """"famous"""" to you is not """"famous"""" to me, and vice versa.  So either we liberally add the word throughout every article, to describe anything that could be considered by anyone to be """"famous"""", or we don't use it at all, unless it was used in a quote or other trivial exceptions.  It was decided a long, long time ago that the latter option would be better, and this was written down in the manual of style.

""""musicologist Joseph Kerman called it"""" is objective, concise, and verifiable.  """"musicologist Joseph Kerman famously called it"""" contains no additional information, only puffery.

White light is a wavefront with power(energy) equally distributed across the visible frequency spectrum. When the wavefront has power levels distributed at different frequencies so that some parts the spectrum have more or less power, then we call that a color. The wavefront that impacts the eye to produce the sensation of Magenta has high power levels in the lower and higher frequencies and low power levels in the center frequencies. It is just one wavefront but shaped in power intensity vs frequency. There is no such thing as different colors of light waves, only a wavefront that has a power vs frequency shape. As such there are not incoming different frequencies of light to produce a color, its just one wavefront. No separate blue or red light enters the eye to be combined and produce a color. The color is inherent in the energy distribution of the wavefront which stimulates the frequency sensitive biological receptors in proportion to the power levels within the wavefront.

It is for this reason that Magenta is (as are all colors) spectral. It is the energy vs frequency distribution of the incoming wavefront that produces the perceived color sensation. Any color you like can be produced by a single tunable light source through modulation.

One wavefront .... not seperate incoming light colors."

   Hi.  I'm not familiar with Doyle or the topic in general, but perhaps I can give you a sense of whether there should/shouldn't be an article on Doyle. With biographies of living people, there are two hurdles on this Wiki, and they largely overlapverifiability and notability. In both cases, usually the question boils down to this:  are there enough reliable, secondary sources that tell us about the subject that we can read them all, and from those sources alone write a reasonably neutral and factual article? In general such sources are going to be things like newspaper articles, magazine articles and books from reliable publishers, anything with a real editorial staff. No press releases, no use of the fellow's own web site, Facebook page, videos, etc.  For athletes like this it's also possible to fill in additional information from reliable databases of results, but notability really requires articles that discuss the subject in some level of detail. Take a look at [{WP:GNG]], and see if that helps you decide.  looks to be at least one such source,  is a reliable reference but only mentions Doyle in passing. Of the 5 sources listed on streetstunts, 4 are don't meet these requirements, and the fifth might or might notI can't tell since the page is dead.  Looks from what I can tell """"borderline"""" with respect to our policies, but since you know the subject in more detail than I do (or at least I assume so) you probably know of specific resources I'm unaware of that might help flesh out the article.

0,"Amandajm: Ignorant Muslim & Disgusting Anti-white Racist
Reading back on racist, Amandajm - I've come to realize that in addition to his muslim name, he veritably hates white people. He deletes info about european history even if such info is based upon accurate inferences. Why he does this should be the subject of debate. My theory is that he's jealous of white culture and history being that he's muslim. Also, it's important to note that muslims of his poor ilk who exhibit such hatred additionally exude homosexual frustrations. This is well documented in psychiatric circles. Why a dirty, white-hating muslim should possess the reponsibility of writing an article on a culture and history not his own is WAY beyond me. If he wants to write about muslim history, he should. But, he shouldn't be given the chance to write about something he obviously knows nothing about and DOES NOT pertain to him. This guy IS NOT european. Honestly, he doesn't deserve to be on wiki at all. 'Stay on your side of the fence', is a motto I always quote.

To that, yesterday I followed up by sending emails to Homeland Security and the FBI Counter-terrorism Division for investigation into who he is and what his motives are. (No, I've not gone off the deep end). I received an automatic response email from the FBI stating that they will look into the matter, and will definitley be following up. Racist muslims of this type are tricky and can pose a risk to the US. Also, I sent an email to wiki complaining about this enemy of europeans and americans.

But then even on the English version I would find that seeing the box code first thing when I open a page for edition is kind of a deal breaker.

 Question about maltose binding protein article 

Hi Victor,

Just now I'm solving this problem with respect to this maltose binding protein tag, I found this article on wiki. And here is what you wrote:

""""...Once the fusion protein is obtained in purified form the protein of interest (X) is often cleaved from MBP with a specific protease. Protein X can then be separated from MBP by passing through the amylose column again.""""

It would be great if you can explain how can """"Protein X can then be separated from MBP by passing through the amylose column again"""" because I have tried it and it doesn't work. My personal guess is since MBP binds to maltose, it simply doesn't bind to amylose resins / column unless maltose is removed beforehand.

Then the question is how to remove maltose from MBP. From Davidson et al. Mechanism of maltose transport in Escherichia coli: Transmembrane signaling by periplasmic binding proteins (1992:

""""Preparation of Maltose-Free MBP

MBP was purified by affinity chromatography and was dialyzed extensively under conditions calculated to remove most of the bound maltose. For some experiments, MBP was denatured in 6M guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) and either dialyzed against 6M Gdn-HCl or passed through a Sephadex G25 column equilibrated with 6M Gdn-HCl before renaturation by dialysis against 10mM KP1 (pH 7.0). UV-difference spectroscopy showed that the bulk of the MBP was free of maltose.""""

Hope to hear from you soon.

My response: 

This is absolutely outrageous.  The ICC is virtually a home for torture: it is as bad as anything Mengeles thought up in the concentration camps: we're dealling with helpless children.  I have contacted the ICC in the past, and Columbia Presbyterian, and it was clear from my conversations with pediatric surgeons that staff there were ashamed of what they carried out: basically in vivo experiments which amounted to torture.

Wikipedia may have a neutral policy but the information you have inserted, and insisted on re-inserting, is wrong.  It may even lead to the death of more children by misleading people into believing the ICC is a safe home for children. It most certainly is not.  There were people such as yourself involved in the Inquisition and the SS!  You cannot defend a """"neutral"""" policy when it amounts to covering up the sadistic treatment of children.  You should be asbolutely ashamed of yourself.

I am not a vandal, I am a father of two, and I am the director of a company in the UK. I insist that Wikipedia stop glossing over the criminal, immoral, behaviour of the ICC.

If you do google searches, go to forums and search their names, or visit internet archives you can find un-disputable information on the band from reputable sources, first hand accounts that are years older than these discussions, and intangible archives kept by internet archives. IF you want more detail read my above rant, your right I do sound mad about this, because I can't see how you can say they do not meet criterea or that this is a vanity page.

They are fairly recently founded and have thus not established themselves as a professional association and charge for premium membership, so one might consider this a commercial link.

What is the criteria for INCLUSION.  There are a number of similar organizations listed, including the itSMF, ISACA, PMI.  In each case I see a membership based organization formed as a non-profit with the intention of helping professionals network.  Is there a Carpenters of Plumbers union.  As far as I can tell the ITSMPA is no different except there seems less undue vendor influence and commercial intent than some of the others.  By the way, each of the above mentioned associations  charge fees and why should an organization have to have tenure - that implies a closed rather than open criteria - exclusive. Where are the specific rules?  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 72.130.138.189   
The """"rules"""" you are asking for are probably most relevantly WP:ELNO and WP:ELYES. However an RfC such as this one may produce a valid local consensus for interpretation of these guidelines.
Following up on the comment """"as far as I can tell the ITSMPA is no different"""", a quick WP:GOOGLETEST shows ITSMPA→2,000 hits, itSMF→577,000 hits, ISACA→538,000, PMI.ORG→432,000. These numbers seem to show a distinct disparity in notability.—  
Oppose: Peer forums with over 1000 members could potentially provide information beyond what the article would contain if it was a featured article. However, from what I can tell, even the peer forums require a paid membership. The free basic membership doesn't give you any more access on the website than is available to the general public. I think that means this fails WP:ELNO #6: """"Links to sites that require payment or registration to view the relevant content, unless the site itself is the subject of the article, or the link is a convenience link to a citation."""" Even if I'm reading it wrong and the free membership does give you access to training and forums, that still fails as that means it requires registration.   }}"""

0,"Well, Arthur, I have printed the paper, and the condition is in fact what Ultra.Power says it is, not your correction. It seems that the paper is not incorrect, but rather correct and pointless.

You have already identified the worst problem: The third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values. However, this problem disappears if we consider only the special case a=e. So let's do that.

We want a function f satisfying f(1)=e and f(n+1)=exp(f(n)), defined as widely as possible. We observe that n=0 and n=1 present no problems: f(0)=1 and f(-1)=0.

To extend f to all positive real numbers, it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length 1, such as [0,1).

And we want f to be continuously differentiable. (The paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on (0,1), or equivalently on (-1,0). This is obviously whacky, but we needn't worry about this because a=e.)

Next, for no obvious (or explained) reason we require that f ' is monotone on the interval [0,1]. From the functional equation f(x) = ln f(x+1) we get f '(x) = f '(x+1)/f(x+1). Hence f '(-1)=f '(0)/f(0)=f '(0), so f ' must be constant on [0,1]! 

Not too surprisingly, the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way: f(x) = exp[x](exp(x-[x])).

Thus what I learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between -1 and 0."

The article states at Iranian calendar#Modern era from 1925 that in 1976, the Shah decreed that Solar Hejri year 1355 became the imperial year 2535. Thus the first imperial year was the year that Cyrus the Great acceded to the throne in 559 BC (not his birth year many years earlier). This would mean that during Gregorian year 2010 the imperial year 2569 would have begun if the Solar Hejri year had not been reinstated in 1978. Your year 2549 would imply a first imperial year 20 years after Cyrus began his reign, after he had conquered many nations, inducing their kings to bring him gifts. This would be even more arbitrary then the beginning of his reign, which is a well known year. His birth year is assigned to be two different years, either 600–599 BC or 576–575 BC. 

Regarding Nowruz, in Achaemenid times the official year began at Nowruz at the vernal equinox, but popular usage placed Nowruz at the summer solstice.

Just as a point of clarification, I think we all have to keep in mind the difference between a reliable result and a valid claim.  I don't think it would be possible to claim that g is not a reliable result - as Bpesta said, it's been replicated far too many times to say it's just an artifact.  The debate is over what this reliable result means (e.g. which theoretical claim about the underlying cause of the effect is valid), and that is a complex, multi-sided, yet-to-be-resolved-if-ever question.  Frankly, I doubt science will have a decent answer to that question until it has a more analytic definition of what intelligence is (and being a bit of a developmentalist myself, I suspect that that definition will be much more subtle than can be captured by a simple measure like IQ), but as it stands, the best we are going to be able to do with this section is discuss g in its basics,and then lay out various interpretations with proper attributions, so that it doesn't look like the section is advocating any one amongst the several competing ideas.

 Disparity between Traditional Jewish Dates and Academic Dates 

User:PiCo, I will desist from making edits in this current article, since I feel my input might be misconstrued or disruptive, and that, of course, would not be my intent. However, please be apprised that there is a vast disparity between the traditional Jewish method of calibrating years based on a carefully guarded oral tradition, as opposed to modern methods used primarily by Christians who rely heavily upon the modern academic methods applied in dating chronology. The two are still reconcilable, but it will take a vast amount of effort and a person of """"long wind"""" (patience) and extreme diligence to even begin to explain where the discrepancies have """"crept-in"""" to ancient chronologies. The Jews insist that there were only 210 years of slavery in Egypt, although the 430 years mentioned in the Hebrew Bible are merely counted from the time of Isaac's birth, until the departure of Israel from Egypt. You see, """"strangers in a land not theirs,"""" really begins with Abraham's seed in the land of Canaan. Anyway, my view is not to interrupt your work, but to let it proceed on course. I would, however, have preferred to see you mention more about the """"other method"""" practiced by mainstream Judaism, whether it is accepted or not by Christian or academic circles. This would have given more balance to the current article. I have an inkling that someone will eventually start another article dealing only the Jewish tradition of biblical chronology.

If I might say, for us, the Scroll of Antiochus is considered a reliable source.

 CERTAIN FLAWS WITH MODERN SCHOLARSHIP:
 
I wish to point out something about modern scholarship that I think we should be aware of. Research has been carried out in France by a certain Christian Robin and André Lemaire on the subject of the 
Queen of Sheba and King Solomon.
 
André Lemaire wrote: “The hypothesis of a Sheba in Northern Arabia at the beginning of the 1st millennium BCE (Noth 1968: 223-224; Würthwein 1977: 121; Eph‘al 21984: 88-89, 227-229; Garbini 1984; Sarkiö 1994:190; Mulder 1998: 509-510) has no basis and is generally abandoned (Robin 1992: col. 1109-1110, 1118; Avanzini 1996: 13; Kitchen 1997b: 128.”
 
He also writes: “The first mention of Sheba in Neo-Assyrian texts is to be dated mid-8th c. BCE with the story of a caravan of 200 camels coming from Tayma and Sheba to Hindanu (Middle-Euphrates) (Cavigneaux – Ismaïl 1990: 339-357; Frame 1995: 300; Younger 2003: 279-282; Holladay 2006: 319-321).”
 
Contrary to modern scholarship, it should be noted here that, in Jewish tradition, king Solomon did not begin his reign in circa 1,000 BCE, as purported by modern scholarship, but rather in circa 843 BCE, as we find in Jewish tradition. Likewise, in Jewish tradition, the first Temple was destroyed in 422 BCE, rather than in the erroneous date used by scholars of the western world to fix its destruction, i.e. in 586 BCE. Modern scholars totally ignore Jewish tradition and wrongly put historical events at least 200 years earlier, which accounts for the discrepancies in calibrating these important events and not finding historical records to substantiate these events.
 
The one major flaw in their critical view of Jewish texts is the belief that if they cannot find an archaeological document affirming a certain event mentioned in the Bible, for them it is as though the event never happened. This is a fallacy in logic.

To begin to tackle this tremendous difficulty with modern scholarship and Jewish tradition, we must first lay down a premise that will follow us all throughout this discussion, and that is the fact that historical records have been kept by Jews since ancient times, and they have often preserved these very written accounts of events by marking their dates in the Seleucid Era counting. This is vital, as without which information, it will be virtually impossible to determine the sequence of events and to correctly compare them with dates in the Julian / Gregorian calendars. 

The Aramaic """"Scroll of Antiochus,"""" known in Hebrew as """"Megillath Benei Hašmonai"""" (The Scroll of the Sons of Asamoneus), is a curious document, alleged by Rabbi Saadia Gaon in his Introduction to """"Ha-Eggron"""" to have been written by the elders of the schools of Hillel and Shammai in the Chaldaic language, meaning, a document that dates back earlier than the book Seder Olam, composed by Rabbi Yose b. Halpetha in the 2nd century CE. In that book, the """"Scroll of Antiochus,"""" we find this remarkable remark, viz., that """"from the Second Temple's rebuilding till the 23rd year of the reign of Antiochus Eupator, son of Antiochus Epiphanes, who invaded Judaea, there had transpired 213 years in total.""""

Romanization for words of English origin
On the MOS:JP talk page, a discussion has been started about including or not including romanizations for words of English origin, such as Fainaru Fantajī in  (for the sake of simplicity, I called this case """"words of English origin"""", more information on semantics here).

Over the course of a month, it has become apparent that both the parties proposing to include or not include those romanizations cannot be convinced by the arguments or guidelines brought up by the other side. Therefore, a compromise is trying to be found that will satisfy both parties. One suggestion on a compromise has been given already, but it has not found unanimous agreement, so additional compromises are encouraged to be suggested.

One universally accepted point was to bring more users from the affected projects in to help achieve consensus, and you were one of those selected in the process.

What this invitation is:
 You should give feedback on the first suggested compromise and are highly encouraged to provide other solutions.
What this invitation is not:
 This is not a vote on including or excluding such romanizations.
 This is not a vote on compromises either.

It would be highly appreciated if you came over to the MOS:JP talk page and helped find a solution. Thank you in advance.   """

ONIH has not addressed the issue, and he has also not answered my question.  

1. I said small would be more appropriate relative to """"minor"""" - """"""""Minor"""" reflects a point of view. """"Small"""" would be more appropriate.""""  Most appropriate would be to not have any modifier.  If the split was so minor, why are so many people still ticked off about it?  And it's not fair to say that the RSF folks left the movement, they just continued pursuing a direction they had pursued for years.  The """"movement"""" is bigger than PSF and PIRA.

2. I did not state that Peter Taylor is a """"mere journalist.""""  If I did, my apologies to Peter Taylor.  Indeed, please point it out where I used the phrase """"mere journalist."""" 

I did state that he has written some excellent books.  For better or worse, historians are not journalists.  They have different schools for each, in fact.  Provos accompanied a documentary broadcast; it's a great publication, but it's not a detailed history of the Provisional IRA.  The wikiepedia entry for Peter Taylor states, """"Peter Taylor born Scarborough, North Yorkshire is a British journalist and documentary-maker who had covered for many years the political and armed conflict in Northern Ireland, the so-called Troubles. From his experience he has written and produced books and television documentaries on the Northern Irish conflict.""""  The entry for J. Bowyer Bell states, """"The Troubles began in Northern Ireland in 1969, and Bell's The Secret Army: the IRA 1916-1970 was published the following year, and was one of the first detailed histories of the IRA along with The IRA by Tim Pat Coogan which was also published in 1970.""""  Many of the people that Taylor interviewed were also interviewed by Bell; and Bell probably interviewed them first and, in some cases, more than once (though Taylor probably interviewed several people multiple times, too).  

3. One Night In Hackney states above that he """" wasn't using one source over another, I was using what the source actually said.""""  But Bell clearly states, as noted above, """"Ruairi O Bradaigh, Daithi O Conaill, and about one hundred others walked out to form Republican Sinn Fein.""""  So, the sources disagree.  At one point, I believe, the word """"twenty"""" was in there.  It is not in there now, and from my view this is appropriate.  If the sources disagree we should not choose one over the other, but instead we should either acknowledge the differences and quote from each or find a way to be neutral  not quoting from either.

4. Once again there has been a dispute in which One Night in Hackney has chosen one source over another and then when confronted with a direct quotation from an alternate source he has chosen to ask questions, change the subject, and deny the validity of the source.  The reality is that Taylor and Bell are both valid sources, and Bell was clearly talking about people walking out of the Ard-Fheis.  Bell might have been wrong, Taylor might be wrong, but we as Wikipedia editors are not in a position to make that determination.  To do so is to engage in Original Research. WH.

So far so good? And what about the compiler and Roa Bastos?

 Regarding your edits to Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey 

I have reverted your edits to these two articles. Please review WP:V to learn about appropriate, reliable sources for the information you keep adding, and also visit WP:LIBEL and WP:BLP to learn about appropriate information in biographical articles of living people. Insinuating that these two individuals are having an affair or are anything other than faithful to their respective significant others is libelous, and against Wikipedia policy. You have not provided a reliable source to support the POV suggested by your edits. WP:NPOV will help you learn about Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy.

The quotes you have added are taken out of contexttheir mentions of a """"crush"""" on each other were done in a joking manner, and another cast member followed their comments by saying she had a crush on both of thembut that's not grounds for speculating that the cast member in question is having an affair with both of them, and if I said or insinuated that she were, that would be libel. These quotes are cast members speaking highly of each other, and frankly, good public relations by supporting their on-screen chemistry and by extension, that of the fictional characters they play. Many other cast members have complimented their co-stars, including PD and EP, but no reliable source has, to my knowledge, ever published information that these two (or any other cast members) were anything other than co-stars who happen to be friends. On the contrary, both speak frequently of their significant others in high esteem (in print and on camera), and speak well of each other's partners. There's also a question of whether such compliments are even relevant in the grand scheme of the article, but that's a moot point because your edits are unsourced, and against the WP:LIBEL policy.  If you have a reliable source for your edits, in accord with WP:Verifiability, then it's a different story, but as it is, your edits are potentially libelous and not in accord with Wikipedia editing policy.

I don't want to advocate on behalf of Cao in any way, so on behalf of the article and Wikipedia let me say that I think the personal ad is not encyclopedic material. There is plenty of secondary material available on Cao so that we don't have to resort to original research to fill out the article. Furtherm this is a very poor source. A posting like this personal ad could have been placed by anyone from anywhere. In this article the link is clearly intended as an innuendo of Cao's (supposed) homosexuality. If that's the case then let's either say so in the article based on wikipedia:reliable sources or leave it out. 
As for this article and the KFA, they're not so bad. Perhaps some editors are too close to the topic. Instead of all this edit warring I suggest that we all relax, go edit articles on North Korean cuisine, small towns in Spain, minor fascist movements of Uruguay or other topics that we might be interested in, yet dispassionate about, and let this topic rest a bit. There's plenty of time to get the history right on this subject.  Cheers, -"

 Ideas for article improvement 
Howdy all, the page is looking considerably better than it did not too long ago... good job everyone!  Looking over it, here are a few thoughts I had:
 Any useful content (or simpler phrasing) in the Fibre Channel 8B/10B encoding article should be merged in and that article set to redirect here
 The """"How it works"""" section should probably be moved down below the """"Technologies that use 8b/10b"""" so that the encoding tables can be made to be a subsection of """"how it works"""".
 While the concept described in the sentence about the Ethernet transformer is correct, the overall statement looks technically wrong since 1000Base-T doesn't use 8b/10b.
 Lastly, it seems like the intro could be re-written to be somewhat easier for laymen to understand.
Anyone interested, please feel free to be bold and do any (or all) of these!  — T-C """

BTW, intensive smoke from plant chimneys was regarded in Rissia in the beginning of the 20th century (before the October Revolution) as a sign (and a sort of an advertisement) of a successfull, intensively working enterprise.

The only lesson I learned for about the umpteenth time is that Wikipedia is a complete pile of garbage, which is why I edit from an IP and can't even be bothered to create a username.  That Grand Slam article is a great example of everything that's wrong with Wikipedia.  It's a terribly written article in which two authors are responsible for almost the entire content.  I nicely corrected a false statement, which you reverted, and then you edited to no longer be false, but instead completely unnecessary and redundant.  You refused to accept an edit to """"your"""" page, threatened to report me to admins (crying to mommy) for accusing you of owing the page, when you and one other user wrote the entirety of the content and refuse to accept corrections, even when the corrections aren't even a matter of content but rather the awful writing on the page.

I can switch my IP address whenever I choose by resetting my router; I only appealed the block because I want to report that awful page to the Baseball Project and want it to be internally consistent.

Wikipedia:Surveillance awareness day
You were supportive of the idea that Jehochman proposed: """"A message is most effective when it matches the format of the media. We're an encyclopedia. On Feb 11, I suggest we fill our front page with articles, blurbs and news about mass spying and privacy. That will send a strong message, and help educate people. It's sort of like what we do on April 1, except serious instead of foolish.""""

Since this proposal received so much support, I and several others have done our best to begin the process of implementation.   That said, the proposal is very controversial with Main Page insiders who have, understandably, objections that boil down to WP:NOTADVOCATE.

It's valuable to have feedback from people who oppose any deviation from the status quo, but we really need feedback from people who understood Jehochman idea, supported it, and could tell us whether we're succeeding in """"implementing the vision"""" that Jehochman laid out and how to improve the proposal.    

If you have the time, would you lend your view over at Wikipedia:Surveillance awareness day.  If you want to see a list of custom content that could be available, we have a Arbitrary mockup #2, that shows lots of proposed content on one page. 

Your feedback is most appreciated.

I ask you to cancel your blockage that is completely unjustified and highly dishonest.

I was ready fully to have a discussion on my article on the discussion page of Bosendorfer when you intervene to prevent me from publishing this article by blocking me indefinitely.

I will complain of your shameful and despicable vandalism that is completely unjustified.

I believe that you let your emotions take over your reason and it is now time to get back to reason.

That is not all. You even blocked me from sending you messages on your talk page. How convenient?!!

Be sure that I will contact the founders of Wikipedia and I will tell them the nightmare people have to go through just to write a less than one page article!

For your information, there are millions of pages on products. See the page on iPod if you are not aware of this fact.

Get back to reason. You have no facts whatsoever to justify your blockage!!

Be sure I will follow the complaint procedure to have this blockage removed.

Are you proud of your shameful behaviour of blocking me for no reasons?

I am perfectly entitled to have my points of view on different people who intervened and to express these points of view. It is perfectly acceptable to have one's own points of view.

Get back to reason. Your behaviour will be assessed by Wikipedia and will be found to be irrational.

I was having a discussion on my article and Andrew Norman and you RobertG joined forces to prevent me from carrying on my open discussion on the Bosendorfer discussion page when I was fully entitled to do so only because you never wanted to see my article published. 

Again, get back to reason!!

Proposal

Look all I am saying is that the term """"Iranian"""" is a very loose term and people can get easily confused when they see this. Iranic would be a better term to use. Nontheless, there is no doubt that the Kurdish language is a bit similar to other languages such as Persian but there is also a difference as well. I am speaking as a Kurd myself. There is evidence that the Kurds have the highest chance out of all the other ethnic groups of being descendants of the Medes, all one has to do is look at lingustics. Although, it is also important to know that the Kurds have been in the middle east for a very very long time, and there have been many other empires/people as well. There have also been, for example, claims that Kurds are also descendants of the Gutians. It all boils down to what you believe, but to say that the Kurds are an Iranian people, is sort of going overboard. 

Kurds have been mentioned for a very longtime by many different people, including the Sumerians!

Nonetheless, I think there should be a change. I sort of agree with the Proposal above but I believe it can be better. Heres what I think should be written

Kurds are an ethnic group in the Middle East that inhabit adjacent parts of Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syira known as Kurdistan. The Kurds speak a language known as Kurdish, which form a subgroup of the NorthWestern Iranian languages. The Kurds are known to be an Iranic people because of close linguistic and cultural ties with other Iranians. The Kurds are also known to be descendants of the Medes, according to many scholars.

Somewhere along those lines. Saying that Kurds are an """"Iranian ethnic group"""" is is vague, confusing, and somewhat mis-leading. What I wrote is a bit more clear and I wrote why they are considered an Iranic people with the sentences supporting it. Notice how I also said a language known as Kurdish. I do not know on what insane consensus that people decided it should be """"Kurdish language(s)."""" Kurdish is one language which is mainly based of two dialects, that are spoken by almost all Kurds. Those two dialects are Kurmanji and Sorani, both of which are highly similar. All Kurds regard their language as one. I am a Kurdish Sorani speaker and I can understand a Kurmanji speaker perfectly. Kurds in Turkey, Syria, and Half of Iraq speak Kurmanji. Then the other Half of Iraqi Kurdistan speak Sorani, with Kurds in Iran speaking Kurdish Sorani as well. There are also a few other dialects such as Hawrami which is spoken by about 10% of Kurds. Nonetheless, the Kurdish language is one language with 2 main dialects, both of which are highly similar to each other.

I'm glad you have decided to contribute to Wikipedia, and I hope you continue to add to the project in the future. However, the article Offley Place as you wrote it met the criterion for deletion for two reasons:

The article did not indicate why the subject met the criteria for inclusion that apply to businesses and organizations.
It did not contain any verifiable, third-party references.
It was written in a promotional, rather than an encyclopedic tone. 
It appeared that the only contributor to the article (you) had a significant conflict of interest with the article subject. That is, it appears that your reason for adding the article to Wikipedia is to promote your business, rather than to improve the encyclopedic content of Wikipedia.

The user Labongo attempts to distort the truth the following way

User Labongo states:  """"your requests for references have been answered hundreds of times.""""

Notice, how again you present a hopelessly goofy claim, user Labongo.  Can you show us one such occasion where what we have been after has been offered to us, in terms of quotes and the related page informaiton ?

No one has asked as an attachment for the Kven text a list of references which disagree with the information offered.  This is the absurd case now.

We need to see where exactly those offered sources agree with the written text offered in the Kven article.  Those sort of pinpointed and exact - easily verifiable (as Mr. Mikkalai wants) - quotes and sources are offered in several key points of the Diki Wiki's text.  For us to ask you to understand the difference in that approach is too much to hope for, it appears.  

You appear to be too young for this sort of conversation, it seems safe to state.  

In the case of user Driakko's text that sort of showing of exact book and page information and - importantly user Labongo - exact quotes on those pages from known and credited historians and/or other scientist cannot be provided.

Read the bold text from the above sentence.  That is what is wanted, not what you claim that has been requested !  Please, read what our messages exactly say.  After you have done that, please stop setting words in the mouths of others, and particularly in the mouths of historians in relation to the Kven text. 

Perhaps just for you - and the types of you - it is important to repeat yet one more time:  We have never asked - and we are not asking now, and we shall not ask in the future - a list of related books an/or historians who have written about the topic.  Instead, we are asking for it to be pointed out where exactly those given sources agree with text pushed for Wikipedia.

We are familiar with the sources offered.  They appear to disagree with the text of user Drieakko !

What part of the word """"disagree"""" do you find hard to understand ?

 

Torne Valley, Northern Norway and today's Kainuu were all part of Kvenland

Torne Valley, the extreme Northern Norway and today's Kainuu were all part of Kvenland.  That is why the languages and accents spoken in those areas at the present day are so closely related to each others.

This is not - and was not - changed considerably by the fact that migration to the historic Kvenland areas from the modern-day areas of Häme and Savo in Finland took place.  

As in other cases of migration usually, the newcomers acquire the language and/or the accent of the locals, not the other way around.  - -  

Diki Wiki text must remain the starting point for any changes/additions requested

Someone above (Drieakko/(Labongo) offered us a source which - according to them -  was """"written by someone"""".  They added, that this shoud satify the need for the requested sources by Steve Wondering (and others).  However, a source """"written by someone"""" does not point to a reliable source which Mr. Mikkalai and us others have been after.  Please, do not offer something as ridiculous as that for a reference !

We suggest that you do as was agreed and concluded in the wide consensus reached by all participants of this forum during April and May (also in early June) of this year.  No changes in the """"Diki Wiki"""" Kven article can be made without proper and detailed references !  That text must be the starting point for any discussions.

Please, do not forget to provide the exact quotes and page numbers of the sources offered for any requested change or addition for the Diki Wiki's Kven text !  You are expected to suggest such possible changes and/or to discuss the content of the Diki Wiki Kven text on this discussion page.  - -

Anyone with a basic familiarity with the Irish language in a modern context will be able to tell you that """"Fianna Fáil"""" means """"soldiers of destiny"""" - fáil being the genitive of fál, destiny, and fianna the plural of fiann, soldier, much as in """"Amhrán na bhFiann"""", the soldiers' song, and Lia Fáil, the rock of destiny. It's the name of a party, for God's sake, and the article about that party also confirms it means """"soldiers of destiny"""": Fianna Fáil. The Fenians were a minor Republican group, and """"Fál"""" isn't even an English word...I'm sorry, but the sources – as I'm sure other speakers of the language, native or otherwise, will be able to confirm – are just wrong. Unless anyone has a legitimate reason to object, I'd like to correct the glaring spelling error in the original Irish, and correct the stupidity of this translation.

 Untrue claim about ADRIAAN RELAND in section 3.2.1 Travelers' impressions of 19th century Palestine 

In section 3.2.1 it is claimed that the Dutch scolar Adriaan Reland visitet Palestine in 1695.

This is false. 
Reland never visitet Palestine.

The source (196. RELANDI HADRIANI Palaestina ex monumentis veteribus illustrata. Trajecti Batavorum, Guilielmi, 1714., pages 648-649) for this claim does not say anything about a travel by Reland to Palestine.

There exists no facts about such a travel.

The biographies about Reland does not mention any travels by Reland to Palesine.

My concern about your username (ItsTAROTCAKEbitches)

Hello, , and thank you for contributing to Wikipedia!

I hope not to seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome, but I noticed your username, and am concerned that it might not meet Wikipedia's username policy. After you look over that policy, could we discuss that concern here?Your username contains the insulting term 'bitches' which may offend other users.

I'd appreciate learning your own views, for instance your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.

You have several options freely available to you:
 If you can relieve my concern through discussing it here, I can stop worrying about it.
 If the two of us can't agree here, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, such as asking for a """"third opinion"""", or requesting comments from other Wikipedians. Admins usually abide by agreements reached through this process.
 If you decide to just go ahead and change your username, it is possible for you to keep your present contributions history under the new username: simply request a new name here following the guidelines on that page, rather than creating a whole new account.

Let me reassure you that my writing here means I don't think your username is grossly, blatantly, or obviously inappropriate; such names get reported straight to Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism (WP:AIV), or blocked on sight. This is more a case where opinions might differ, and it would be good to reach some consensus — either here or at WP:RFC/NAME. So I look forward to a friendly discussion, and to enjoying your continued participation on Wikipedia. Thank you again!    """

 About Corticopia 

Corticopia's past 

Hello:

I just want to share with you some information you might consider important. We had a very difficult time months ago removing Mexico from Central America in the article North America. Why? Because an """"anonimous"""" user (IP from Toronto Canada) was reverting all the changes. I finally discovered he was an already registered user and got him blocked because of sockpuppetry. One month later, I found out he was already been accused of sockpuppetry with that account.

Well my point is that he is against of Mexico being included in North America. His main """"argument"""" was that the UN geosheme includes Mexico in CA and that's it. He also denies that North America is also a subregion of America and ignores the cited content proving him wrong. Well, he is Corticopia. For months he was retired and trust me, NO BODY changed the articles North America and Central America (specially this one) to say Mexico was in CA.

Suddenly a """"new"""" user shows up. He deleted a line in the article CA. It said """"Mexico is rarely, yet sometimes included in Central America under certain definitions"""". This line was discussed and agreed. He changed it to """"Mexico is included in Central America"""" then to """"Mexico is sometimes included in Central America"""".

I don't know what his problem is. The important thing is I totally felt this is the same person we had a very serious vandalism problems months ago, so I checked his edit list. Wow! What a discovery, his first edit was the article Issac Asimov and articles about Canada and some other regions of the world. It was very obvious it was the same person. Please check this sources  and this . Please, read them carefully.

Please check the contributions of each accused sockpuppetry account, specially the one of User:Ex post factoid. It is very obvious he is the same person.

He was dragged into the article Mexico when he was unable to """"win"""" again in the article Central America (he didn't even try to change the article North America because he knows a lot of people guard that article). So his reason to say Mexico is in """"Southern North America"""" are purely false and personal. He wants to """"exclude"""" Mexico or make it """"look"""" appart from Canda and the USA.

I'm telling you this because I think you don't realize his reasons are just personal, a personal aversion against Mexico being included in North America. If he's so interested in accuracy of the articles, why isn't he editing the article USA? He even asked Supaman to do it by himself. He's just there to exclude Mexico. Please read carefully the evidence provided in each sockpuppetry case. You said that you're an administrator in Spanish Wikipedia, so I think you're experienced in these cases. You will find it is the same person. Cortiopia has edited the same pattern of articles that the other accounts did. Too bad I warned him and I'm sure he stopped editing with that account to prevent being identified. I think we should stop him and prevent him from editing the article with his biased, excluding information, even if sourced, because his reasons are just personal and not for the sake of accuracy.

This article, like all Wiki's, purports to have:-

i) 'Scientific focus: Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and its content on scientific and quasi-scientific topics will primarily reflect current mainstream scientific consensus.'

and

ii) 'Neutral point of view as applied to science: Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, a fundamental policy, requires fair representation of significant alternatives to scientific orthodoxy. Significant alternatives, in this case, refers to legitimate scientific disagreement, as opposed to pseudoscience.'

Surely there is already a cultural bias, in the West, reflected in its science, which effectively imposes some kind of Conversion therapy (or its opposite?) on its citizens: there is a manufactured consensus, arrived at by undemocratic and concealed means, that 'it's okay to be LGBT,' which doesn't come clean about the physical and social consequences.80.229.223.248"

Hi there. As the creator of the page, I got one of those newfangled notification thingies when you templated the article. Could you be a little more specific about what you feel the problem areas are? The tag you used implies that the problem is that there are references, but they're not inline citations - but they're all inline already. Your edit summary said that it should have more footnotes, by which I assume you mean references cited. I know there's no hard and fast rules about that stuff, but six isn't too bad for a start-class article and every paragraph is supported by at least one reference, so I'm thinking there must be something specific that you feel isn't covered adequately. Could you elaborate a bit (here, or maybe the article talk page would be better)? Most articles on WP could use a few more references, but article tagging is usually reserved for articles with sections of material that are entirely unreferenced or when there's specific concerns like BLP, neither of which I think is the case here."

OK, when I refreshed my memory by looking at a map, I realized that Elliott Bay and Lake Washington squeezing in in the middle is probably at least 60% of the problem, so I generalized it some, although it's now a little wordier. Basically, at least for a straight road (ie following the grid), it's pretty much limited to the area of the Montlake Cuta street between Lake Union and Portage Bay would run into the Duwamish, adding the cost of a second bridge.
And, indeed, if you include Lake City Way, and MLK Way, 23rd/25th does indeed come closest to qualifying (as connecting N boundary to S). (I don't feel strongly about having the explanation here, I just added it to answer the question that I thot many readers would have.)

As for Madison being the only E<>W, the offset downtown grid doesn't help, bodies of water play a part, tho' not as much (even tho' the Duwamish is generally narrow enuf for a bridge, there aren't going to be many built). Hills probably do make up most of the rest of the reason (at least besides the fact the probably no one really made it a goal). I assume the reason Madison does is related to the ferry it used to serve that crossed Lake Washington, tho' I don't know offhand which came first. (Yesler probably would also be one, except the for the hill on the east end.)

PS I like your additions to the layout article (I don't have any Seattle/King County street maps down here [but ordered a King Co Thomas Guide earlier today], so I was mostly going from memory about which cities, although I should have remembered Shoreline, since I lived there a few years, and Mercer Island, since my dad worked there about 20 yrs), and THANK YOU for fixing """"road label""""I knew it was bad, but was having a mental block as to how to fix it. Oh, and leaving out """"numbering"""" there is fine.

PPS Turns out the road preceded the ferry, which wasn't planned at the time, so they're less connected than I thot. I guess the reason is that the street was made by someone that wanted the connection, and owned enuf land he could do it, and did it back when it was still possible; probably a rare combination.  20:20, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)"""

No matter what your thoughts, unless you think the Nobel prize winner is just lying, this is pretty intriguing stuff.  He filters out all know bacteria, even to 1/5th of the size, and then takes the water and regrows the original bacteria?  With many types of bacteria?  He even notes that it must be succussed?  Whether or not it has anything to do with homeopathy doesn't change the marvel of what this first look into this new type of data holds as it is very interesting.  I chuckle to see the anonymous """"layperson"""" editors immediately discrediting nobel prize winners research because they must be a quack.  You are writing in wikipedia.

 Why compare only to Windows 2000 features? 

As this issue has clearly caused quite a bit of confusion, I've decided to address it here. Windows XP is in the unique position - compared to all other Windows releases I can think of - of being at the convergence point of two separate Windows product lines, that of Windows NT and the old, MS-DOS-based Windows 9x. However, the core code in XP is based on the former and not the latter (hence XP has an internal version number of 5.1, while Windows 2000 has one of 5.0 - among numerous other things). A list of every single feature included in Windows ME (the last of the MS-DOS based versions) but not in XP would be quite long indeed, and also quite pointless, because it would be comparing operating systems of two very different architectures. (There's also the fact that comparisons between the other """"List of features removed in Windows"""" articles and this one would actually be made far more difficult.)   """

Ice treaty?
This caught my interest:
According to a contract which had been signed, Russian America had to deliver a certain amount of ice to San Francisco at a fixed price.
Anyone here have any idea if this was with an American company or with the Hudson's Bay Company, which maintained a post at San Francisco, though perhaps not this late (their post was at Yerba Buena (town) and had been founded in 1830.  The reason I propose the HBC is that there was a treaty - more than one - between the RAC and the HBC on the latter's provisions of dairy and meat and vegetables to Russian America; maybe there was a reciprocal agreement.  I can't imagine what treaty'' the RAC/Russia would have had with the United States that could have signed between 1824 and 1859....unless this has something to do with US support during the Crimean War?  Or??  If it's a contract with a private company (other than the HBC), then """"treaty"""" is not the right word to use.  if it's a corollary to the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1839 or the earlier arrangements with either the Pugets Sound Agricultural Company  or some grandfathered contract re the agreement with Mexico over Fort Ross, somebody please explain....

Alan, I'm not sure what you think is compromised ... could you clarify? The core issue we are discussing relates to the template/contents of an Integral portal page that actually reflects the integral movement as it exists. AQAL is one author's (Ken Wilber's) name for his particular developmental model. It is already described in the wikipedia's Ken Wilber article and nobody has suggested that a separate page be added for it. The issue is whether thinkers who call themselves integral and are generally understood and acknowledged as """"integral thinkers"""", doing work that is called """"Integral Studies"""", can simply be identified in the Integral portal page as such, no matter what their particular sect or affinity, (which is all that I have suggested), or whether such thinkers need to be divided a priori into pro-Ken Wilber and anti-Ken Wilber camps, or """"Integral (AQAL)"""" and """"Integral"""", as it seems you may now be proposing. Obviously term AQAL (or even Wilberian for that matter) can be used inoccuously to describe Wilber's own writings. But how does a wikipedia editor decide that a work that calls itself integral (not AQAL) is not suitable for an integral portal page but only an AQAL portal? Even I did so once, as you noted. But it is quite another for a wikipedia editor to declare that certain thinkers or books cannot be linked or acknowledged at an integral portal but only an AQAL portal, based on some subjective interpretation of their use of elements of AQAL theories. I still do not see an answer for whether you would allow Robert Kegan into the integral portal or whether you would insist that he be listed under AQAL only, and I could ask the same question about dozens of writers who cite Wilber as one of many influences. Without a principled and objective answer, I think you are asking wikipedia editors to step into a totally untenable position. As I wrote earlier:
...usually thinkers use some aspect of Wilber's thought combined with the thought of many other sources, seldom use every feature of AQAL, and often disagree about key points. On what basis do you insist that people who call their thought integral actually be considered Wilberian? How much of Wilber's thought must one agree with to be so classified, and who decides? When you acknowledge that a thinker such as Robert Kegan has """"mutually influenced"""" Wilber and yet is part of the integral school of thought, would you propose to create a new Integral portal for such hard-to-classify thinkers, and segregate every thinker that displays too much affinity to Wilber or his model into a separate category, either explicitly called """"Integral theory (Wilberian)"""" or """"Integral theory"""" (but with the Wilberian association implicit, with a wikipedia editor such as yourself presumably determining whether every new thinker is sufficiently anti-Wilber to be listed in the main category)? 
I have not proposed that AQAL be used as a synonym for integral at all, only that any thinker who describes their work as integral and is generally acknowledged as such by independent sources be listed or linked at the integral portal in an appropriate fashion. Since, perhaps, some 90% of thinkers describing themselves as integral today are influenced to one degree or another by Wilber, the consequence of using the term integral in a neutral, objective way as I have proposed may very well be that many themes and ideas treated at the integral portal will be connected to AQAL in some fashion. Again, I will say that in my opinion the right place for your concern about AQAL being inappropriately used as a synonym for integral is in reviewing the content of the pages rather than in denying the usefulness of an integral portal at all.

YOU, on the other hand, wrote a contribution that DID add content to the story that could NOT be verified through a reliable source, making it YOUR OPINION.  You said things like  """"... when a neighboring police agency was needed and requested by the chief of police to intervene in the criminal conduct of Arvada's police force.""""

This is libelous, because you accuse the Arvada Police Department of """"criminal conduct"""" when no criminal conduct has been proven in a court of law.  Even the officer who is alleged to have done the hitting has been found """"not guilty"""" by your peers. Because no one is convicted in the link you provide (or ANY link ANYWHERE on the Internet), it is your OPINION.  If you had used the phrase """"ALLEGED criminal conduct"""" you would be more on track.

You also wrote: """"Arvada's city council had chosen not to intervene in the previous criminal conduct of several members of the Arvada police, despite a cost to the city of close to half a million dollars defending the criminal actions of one police officer alone, during a period of budget crises.""""

The """"close to half a million dollars"""" was NOT spent """"defending the criminal actions of one police officer alone.""""  The money was spent settling OUT OF COURT so that the accusations had no opportunity to be proven as fact.  A """"criminal"""" is someone who has been CONVICTED of a crime. So there cannot be """"criminal actions"""" unless someone has been convicted of a crime.  There CAN be """"alleged questionable actions,"""" which is what you should have written. 

When you post hateful things about others that is just your opinion, that opens you up to a LIBEL SUIT.  If you do it in a blog, and you make it clear that you are expressing your opinion and not facts, you can say whatever you like there without much fear of libel.  But when you post to a site whose premise is encyclopedic content, you cannot just post what you THINK.  You must post what can be VERIFIED.   Do you understand this very basic principle?  Please read it again if you don't, because I'm done trying to educate you.

Definition of libel (I encourage you to visit the link and read all its contents):  http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-libel.htm

Libel involves false statements knowingly presented as fact. In the United States opinion is protected as a tenant of freedom of speech, falling outside the purview of libel. Citizens retain the right to comment on public figures and entities, including government and officials. Entertainment, parody, editorials and criticisms that may arguably misrepresent facts are not libelous so long as they are presented for amusement or stated as mere opinion. 

From:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation

How to prove libel:  There are several ways a person must go about proving that libel has taken place. For example, in the United States, the person first must prove that the statement was false. Second, that person must prove that the statement caused harm. And, third, they must prove that the statement was made without adequate research into the truthfulness of the statement. These steps are for an ordinary citizen.

 WTF?! want != need 

Obviously, the idiot that wrote """"the need for instant gratification"""" failed economics 101. A need is something you must have for survival; that isn't instant gratification. A want is something that you would like to have but can live without.

The guy that edited this is probably a consumerist moron with thousands in credit card debt. Debtors are fools that shouldn't be allowed to own anything. This is why a fully market economy can't end poverty. Only those with a proper education should be allowed to participate in a market economy. Fools that don't know the difference between a want and a need should be owned by their employer. Their employer can better determine what they need than themselves. Poverty would be eliminated by this mix of a command and market economies. The remaining unemployed, fat, and lazy fools can go to jail.

Ian, I am sorry to see this sad state of affairs. I noticed your first revert on karate when I got home from the karate dojo last night and considered dropping you a line about the extent of grappling in karate from my own experience. I was however quite exhausted from doing a lot of grappling and picking myself up off the floor numerous times. In my style, Shotokan, the philosophy is to take out an opponent with one blow (ippon) so as to be ready for any others, but we still train in grappling and escapes quite a lot. The movements in any kata can be interpreted in many ways, from the obvious to very complex applications from apparently simple movements. There is no way of knowing if the ancient masters who composed the classic katas had these in mind.

 Gneiss 

Hello, Vsmith  I just finished going through the article on Gneiss. I made a few copy-edits and moved a few sentences. (I hope you approve.) I noticed a few things that I felt I had better ask you about before changing anything:

1) I noticed there was a section called """"Types"""" that contains only two sentences, and that the first of those is a repetition of a sentence I saw earlier at the end of the section headed """"Composition"""". I don't think the sentence needs to be repeated, but I didn't know which place was best for it.

2) The section on """"Etymology"""" starts with this sentence:

The etymology of the word gneiss is disputed.

but then we read of only one theory as to the origin of the word. If the etymology is disputed, shouldn't at least one other theory be given?

3) In the second paragraph in the section Gneiss#Gneissic banding, the word """"relatively"""" appears four times. I'm wondering whether all of them are necessary.

4) Regarding the images:

(a) I think they could be arranged better than they are. The first two images after the lead image are bunched close to the top. Wouldn't it be better if they were next to the sentences that mention those types of gneiss?

(b) The first image after the lead image mentions Augen gneiss from Brazil, but nowhere in the article does it say that gneiss is found in Brazil.

(c) The third image after the lead image mentions gneiss from New York State, but nowhere in the article does it say that gneiss is found in New York State. Also, there is no mention of gneiss found in New England or any of the western states.

(d) There is a whole section called Gneiss#Lewisian gneiss, and a whole section called Gneiss#Archean and Proterozoic gneiss, but there is no image of Lewisian, archean, or proterozoic gneiss. 

I don't mind searching for images, but I don't know where to look and would need advice on uploading and licenses. -   """

1) It is a biased view from a man who managed Henry for years.

Here are some facts: 
 
All Silesia is situated entirely in Magna Germania territory .

Silesia territory was part of the Holy Roman Empire  by 900 AD (as lien to Moravian, Bohemian dukes). It was conquered by  Boleslaw I Chrobry, a duke of the western Polans, who pledged allegiance to the Holy Roman Empire. The eastern Polans came from the Dnjpr area further west into Germania and are thus named western Polans.

You just try to found reasons to shut me up and abuse your status as admi to do so but ain't not better than YBM.
You are doing exactly the same as him.
Why do you remove my answer TO YOUR ARTICLE from the main frame and let the answer made by YBM and others for exemple?
This is clearly discrimination.
My answer is all too relevant to the affair discussed as are all my article as the last ones have to do with the crdibility of the people who have been the upmost against the Bogdanovs and have critisize their theory the most.
I do not think that a DEA in informatic make a person capable to critisize the work of professionals in theorethic Physic. To do so you will have to be Stephen W Hawking and the alike.
I have pointed how discusting the methods of YBM were and was able to come with tangibles prooves of it.
Thats why he hurried to deleet them.
But you came, afet 6 days he had done that and 6 days I tried to put it back, and...banished me!!!
then after 9 days in all, you wrote your first intervention in this site and gave a warning to YBM, but.. you failled to punish him as well, and you commited the grave mistake to accuse me of having perpetrated the same kind of crime as he did, and by doing so, bagatelize the incident as being a commun little fight between 2 stupid users deleting each others column.
But it isn't at all what happened.
My answer to your intervention, more than being an internal dispute, had as goal to put things back where they belong, and regarded all users.
They have to know that this YBM did deleeted my texts for a whole week, without any admin interventions, that you did bannished me but not him, and that you did bannished me again but not him, for personal reasons, and at the same time hinder the users to see the facts by removing them from where they belong and place them outside.
You don not have answered any of my questions, and for you to know Cereal Killer is the admi of the french site about the bogdanov affair and is therefor very relevant to this case.
As for your accusation of my pseudo crimes of having written in french, I wrote in french on heat after having read your answer, and translated it dtraight away in english, and the french version was no more than 10 to 15 minutes on line in the middle of the night, so do stop try to agress with lies, be more honnest with yourself, at least and say it as it is: you prefer the opinion of YBM, do not like the Bogdanov, thought you do not understand a thing about astrophysic, and you feel nothing but hatress and repulsion about me and what I stand for.

00:17, 6 October 2015 C.Fred (talk | contribs) deleted page Signa Vianen (A7: Article about a real person, which does not credibly indicate the importance or significance of the subject) 
I urge you to delete the reference stating that the Article was about a real person, which not etc. etc. 

Are you implying that I lack importance or even significance, because a Wiki page did not utterly describe me. I did not publish the page about myself, and when I saw it years ago, I left it at that. I only checked if the facts were OK and over the years somebody sometimes helped me to make a few changes. But I never bothered about it so much as to expand it by adding all kinds of sources. no need. 
My relevance is not to be measured by how many articles I published in your country, because I was never a journalist in your country. In fact, you wouldn´t even be able to understand anything I wrote because I am not even English speaking. You are clearly going by double standards here.  When a Wiki editor uses words like crap whenever editing pages about living people, credible people with a solid track record, that in itself is UNACCEPTABLE. And I was not the only one complaining about ´´him´´.
Also, please be aware of the FACT that there are a number of pages, people with my similar background, cultural background that is, who have even less data. And there is nothing wrong with that, because among ourselves we know our importance. Nobody from out of nowhere will come in and refer to it as CRAP. I was attacked by a stalker yesterday and I called it to Wiki´s attention because it was one crazy addition to the page. The stalker even changed my nationality, changing me into a Caribbean national which I am most definitely not. I guess that kind of gibberish will prompt the creeps to come out and complete the feast.

I know that the Croatian perspective is somewhat different. This comes from a very specific historiographical school, which had among its roots Grga Novak. Assuming that Dalmatia was one of the most primitive of Europe at the time of Venetian domination, we must also think that since 1797 to the date you specified (1945) they are 150 years. Josip Smodlaka stated in 1911 (1911!) that Dalmatia was still one of the poorest regions of Europe. As you can understand, we can not talk only of the Italian evil foreign rule to explain this fact.

Oh, what a mess. Multiple formats bedevil the writing of a logically-structured encyclopedia! I can see valid arguments for maintaining (although how much that needs to be done is moot) different chronologies for UK and US releases, because of the various Columbia chop-ups that were released in the early years, but trying to keep them in step is an arduous task. Most Beatles albums tend to be listed in order of their UK release (which usually preceded other locations), and that, per WP:ENGVAR, should IMHO be the norm as regards principal chronology. There's no issue with listing colonial releases in the main article, but little to be gained in having separate articles. As regards this one, as far as the UK is concerned, it was a double EP, and I see no problem in describing that initial release as an """"album"""", for simplicity's sake, and all variations should follow from that. However, this article is but an outpost of WP:Beatles and perhaps some wider input would be useful. andemu """

 Liver regeneration and the Greeks 

On this page and the Prometheus page, someone has added a reference giving a bogus definition for the Greek word for liver, hêpar, claiming that it  derives from the verb hêpaomai, meaning to mend or repair. Thus hêpar is supposed to translate as, """"repairable."""" This derivation is fanciful. I'm surprised it lasted as long on Wiki as it has since it wasn't even confirmed by the original source given! I've deleted this bogus definition. I doubt you need references for a deletion, but here are some anyway: J. Pokorny, Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch (Bern and Munich: Francke, 1959), pp. 325, 504; P. Chantraine, Dictionnaire étymologique de la lange grecque (Paris: Klincksieck, 1990), p. 414; H. Frisk, Griechisches etymologisches Wörterbuch, Vol. I (Heidelberg: Carl Winter, 1973), pp. 638-9. These sources make it very doubtful that hêpar was related to hêpaomai.

I've also changed some text in the section on Liver Regeneration which asserted that the myth of Prometheus proves that the ancient Greeks must have known about the liver's remarkable capacity to repair itself. Actually this is a matter of some dispute. I've changed the text to reflect this controversy. I’ve looked at a great deal of literature on the subject and have found only one attempt to actually argue that the Greeks knew about liver regeneration: Chen T and Chen P (1994). """"The Myth of Prometheus and the Liver."""" Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine 87(12): 754-755. I've added a reference and link to this. I've also referenced and linked to a historically detailed critique of this position: Power C and Rasko J (2008). """"Whither Prometheus' Liver? Greek Myth and the Science of Regeneration."""" Annals of Internal Medicine 149(6): 421-426. This is by far the most comprehensive treatment of this topic.

The addition of the above references made an existing reference redundant (ie Michalopoulos, George K., and DeFrances, Marie C., """"Liver regeneration”. Science, 4 April 1997: Vol. 276. no. 5309, pp. 60-66), so I removed it. Like a great many articles on regenerative medicine, the Michalopoulos article simply asserts that the Greeks must have known about liver regeneration, citing the the myth of Prometheus as its only evidence. Chen and Chen go much further than this. Likewise Power and Rasko.  

 Gray's image 

While accurate, the Gray's image is of terrible resolution and greatly inferior to other freely available images. While this 19th century image is of historical significance, I believe a modern, perhaps scalable, image would be more appropriate for an encyclopedic article.
  

Invitation to edit
It is proposed that Liver be part of the trial of a new template; see the green strip at the top of Pain where it has been in place for a couple of months. The purpose of this project is to encourage readers to edit, while equipping them with the basic tools. If you perceive a problem with this, or have any suggestions for improvement, please discuss at the project talk page   .

She was catpured at Carfou at you suspected, but her nationality remains a mystery. She sustained 11 wounded in her captured by HMS Goliath. Her crew numbered 44 men in1798 and 30 on 18 March 1799. She was armed with 6 guns, which in May 1798 amounted to 2 18-pounders and 4 1-pounder swivel guns.

http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/climategate_how_the_cabal_controlled_wikipedia

One person in the nine-member Realclimate.org team — U.K. scientist and Green Party activist William Connolley — would take on particularly crucial duties.

Connolley took control of all things climate in the most used information source the world has ever known – Wikipedia. Starting in February 2003, ... Connolley set to work on the Wikipedia site. He rewrote Wikipedia’s articles on global warming, on the greenhouse effect, on the instrumental temperature record, on the urban heat island, on climate models, on global cooling. On Feb. 14, he began to erase the Little Ice Age; on Aug.11, the Medieval Warm Period. In October, he turned his attention to the hockey stick graph. He rewrote articles on the politics of global warming and on the scientists who were skeptical of the band. Richard Lindzen and Fred Singer, two of the world’s most distinguished climate scientists, were among his early targets, followed by others that the band especially hated, such as Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, authorities on the Medieval Warm Period.

All told, Connolley created or rewrote 5,428 unique Wikipedia articles. His control over Wikipedia was greater still, however, through the role he obtained at Wikipedia as a website administrator, which allowed him to act with virtual impunity. When Connolley didn’t like the subject of a certain article, he removed it — more than 500 articles of various descriptions disappeared at his hand. When he disapproved of the arguments that others were making, he often had them barred — over 2,000 Wikipedia contributors who ran afoul of him found themselves blocked from making further contributions… In these ways, Connolley turned Wikipedia into the missionary wing of the global warming movement.

The reverted edits fromOnline Shopping and Electronic Commerce which cover the four central claims have those references you quote. The newspaper cuttings can be found in date order at Press Cuttings, Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton. There are no paqe numbers. In the Michael Aldrich article other references are also used. There are three central claims - he invented an online shopping system[he actually claims to have invented online shopping, which I left for peer review],Thomson Holidays 1981 was the first recorded B2B and Gateshead SIS/Tesco was the first B2C with the world's first recorded online shopper.

For the third, there is a peer reviewed source and a TV interview by Lawrence McGinty, an acclaimed UK science reporter, broadcast on Independent Television News in the UK in 1984.

half of it is pure quackery. that wouldn't be so bad if it didn't mix up the nonsense with the reasonable parts, the reader could still stick to the latter. But mixing up respectable 19th century scholarship, Elst's tendentious speculations and complete loonies like Frawley, Knapp and anonymous websites makes it essentially useless. 
""""OIT supporters believe that the idea that Sanskrit is a language originating with Central Asian nomadic people who have been described as """"primitive"""", is very improbable""""
— this is from Frawley's """"Sanskrit is supposed to be the language of primitive invaders"""", so first of all it belongs in the Frawley section. What """"OIT supporters""""? Schlegel? And then Frawley doesn't even himself call the invaders """"primitive"""", he alleges that """"AIT supporters"""" allege that invaders were """"primitive"""", so it remains unclear who """"has described"""" Indo-Iranians as """"primitive"""" in the first place. Frawley doesn't understand the first or last thing about linguistics of course, he is just piling on rhetorics. therefore this article has just two possibilities:
separate the loony stuff (Frawley, Knapp and friends) into a separate """"popular/religious literature"""" section, and keep the main part focussed on scholarly discussion (peer-reviewed linguistic journals and the like)
tag the whole article as pseudoscientific Hindutva Cateogry:propaganda and be done with it

Ugly Personal Attacks - You Approve??

""""Good Morning, Philippe. The post above yours, by LoverofArt, is typical of his posts in my direction. An ugly personal attack, by a person who has in essence defamed a widely respected organization  the National Civilian Community Corps  by posting false and misleading information at the Wikipedia website.
If your / Wikipedia's best idea is that what should happen next is that I enter into a prolonged dialogue with that person, hoping to reason with him/her, while he/she continues to exert control over content and issue ugly diatribes, then your processes leave a great deal to be desired. A responsible adult  a real Editor  should have interceded long ago.

He/she and the others working over the NCCC text at this time seem to feel that any statement introduced by the phrase """"According to ___,"""" does not belong at Wikipedia. As I read it, there was objection at one of your pages to placing references at the end of that phrase rather than at the end of the quotation. Why an encyclopedia would have as a policy including bald claims (as if fact) without reference to the source in its text eludes me. It would give the impression that the encyclopedia had evaluated the statement, which is obviously not the case.

I appreciate Wikipedia's effort to provide freely accessible information to the public. I am not impressed, however, by the response to gross errors made at the Wikipedia site. Your crew is attacking the messenger at least in part because it is the message that it does not like.
A pretty sorry performance, which you seem to be joining by failing to address the issues I raise or the attacks on me.

Of course attempting to talk about innocents in the west is out because there deaths are the governments fault in your mind. So lets go to Iraq, where over 10 barbers have been killed in the name of """"Land recovery from fachist invaders"""", no wait i got that wrong they have been killed because (wait for it this crime is up there with pedophilia) they shave mens beards off!

Lets move to another country involved in islamic terrorisms war on us, Thailand, where """"Land recovery from fachist invaders"""" takes the form of terrorists many from indonesia killing native buddist Thai's for the crime of Pig Farming or collecting rubber tree sap off the land has been theirs for THOUSANDS of years. This list goes on and on. I'll believe islam has nothing to do with terrorism when suicide bombers are no-longer video'd with a Koran in one hand and an assult-rifle in the other, but until then i'll just call it the religion of peace and everone else will laugh at that sick joke.  

Ps as to Judaic terrorism & Christianity terrorism please create them as ibet there is anough notable cases for articles like Zionist political violence and pro-life groups already have pages on wikipedia.

Binksternet's paranoid and frightening theory propounded about Geraldine Edwards is both unwarranted and inappropriate. He has no grounds or factual element to support his theory in general, which is pure conjecture and supposition. What's more, it's not his place within the rules of Wikipedia editing to mount a personal editorial based on his personal feelings towards a person. His hypothesis that a rouge IP editor from San Diego mounted a campaign to raise the profile of Geraldine Edwards to the level of Bebe Buell, slander Mary Ambrose, and attach Geraldine Edwards to the creation of Almost Famous is so preposterous as to be laughable.
Other Wikipedia editors who have tried to defend Geraldine Flemming-Mueller against Binksternet's attacks upon her were met with threats leveled by him. His interest in Geraldine Flemming-Mueller is unhealthy and alarming, and it would be in his best interest to step away from this situation altogether, as he fails to maintain a neutral stance, which is one of Wikipedia's precepts, on the subject of her. That being said, Geraldine Edwards is not a 'hoax', she's simply a woman who's living the life she see's fit, and is not interested in being included in Wikipedia articles. And finally, posting any inappropriate, hostile information against a living person that may harm them is clearly being flouted by Binkstenet's many malignant comments posted on Wikipedia's pages regarding Geraldine Edwards, one of the main guiding principles of Wikipedia. It's time for him to stand down.
The San Diego college angle is still quite active with regard to Geraldine Edwards; see User_talk:Zabadu#Geraldine_Edwards_is_not_a_hoax which was started by the IP 130.191.109.76 registered to San Diego State University.[17] This writer said """"Approximately a couple of years ago when Mary Ambrose was visiting San Francisco, she met Binksternet, and they became friendly,"""" a statement that is complete bunk. Nothing in the IP's post is supported by reliable sources.
All of this effort to defame Ambrose and build up Edwards is astonishingly trivial. It is a waste of my time, a waste of Mark's time and a drag on Wikipedia to have to deal with it. As long as there are no reliable sources to back up the allegations, they must stay out of the encyclopedia. Editors who repeatedly disrupt Wikipedia are usually blocked. Binksternet (talk) 
Whatever. Binksternet gives new credence to the phrase """"Legend in his own mind"""". Although I respect many Wikipedia editors for their diligent, accurate and commendable contributions, Binksternet is not numbered among them. In no way will I and many others link his name to veracity and credibility. His deny, deny, deny style reminiscent of certain members of the government is amusing if nothing else. Unfortunately, this diatribe has impressed me with nothing of any value. This matter is settled and over and done with, and this is the last time I will edit on this subject on these pages. Thank you to Mark Arsten for acting in a competent, intelligent and unbiased manner here, and my apologies to him for any potential problems my editing may have caused him regarding this subject. Thank you. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 174.77.220.178 (talk)

The stele of Tjetjy clearly identifies Intef III as the son of Intef II (see article on Intef II) so Neferu was indeed Intef III's sister (at least half-sister through her father).

The SPÖ in Mein Kampf

At one moment Hitler lauded the Social Democratic Party in his mind (Friedrich Austerlitz, Anton David, Viktor Adler and Wilhelm Ellenbogen are mentioned by their last names on p. 66 of Mein Kampf) for championing """"das allgemeine und geheime Wahlrecht"""" (Mein Kampf, p. 39) or universal suffrage, saying to himself that this must lead to a weakening of Habsburg monarchic rule. When he later saw more of what the party was about however, he suggested its members were disfavoring Germans in an attempt to save the multiethnic melting pot of Austria-Hungary. It appears he was pressured to join the trade union and that men of Jewish heritage were influential in the party (Mein Kampf, pgs. 39, 40, 65 and 66).Mein Kampf, Erster Band, 2. Kapitel   """

 Polyspermy 

Before you revert the stable version - please discuss this first on the talk page. As for your question:
Look at the beginning of the third line. The Talmud quotes the verse from 1 Samuel 17, 4, which goes as follows: """"And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines"""", right? Now, look at your Bible - ibid., and see the full verse: """"And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath..."""". Right?
So, the Talmud quotes the verse about Goliath, and then: interprates this verse - using a pun - in the following way (see the Talmud ibid. in that third line): """"One hundred foreskins of Philistines - got her [i.e. his mother] pregnant"""". In other words: the Talmud explains, that the biblical words """"And there went out a champion"""" - mean:  """"And there was created/born a champion"""", and it also explains that the biblical words: """"out of the camp of the Philistines"""", mean: """"out of a hundred foreskins of Philistines"""". Note that this fantastic interpretaion made by the Talmud - is based on a pun: the word for """"camp"""" is similar to (i.e. sounds like) """"a hundred foreskins"""" (not in English of course). Note also that fantastic interpretaions for the Bible - are very common in the Talmud.
Now, look ibid. at the next line (i.e. the fourth line); The Talmud now explains how - having so many fathers - is really possible from a biological point of view, so the Talmud continues: """"Rav Matania said: no controversy over that; as long as the sperm [of the first man] hasn't gotten rotten [in the woman's body] yet, a woman can get pregnant by two men - all at once"""".
Notice that all of the Talmud's commentators explain all of this - as I did.
Hope this helps. Anyway, next time, please consult pefore you revert the stable version.

Additionally, helicopters are a valuable asset to aviation, and assist in saving far more lives than fixed-winf aircraft ever can. Not only that, but the rotor-wing segment of Flight Simulation (introduced in 1998 when Microsoft forst released a helicopter simulation with the Bell JetRanger in Flight Simulator 98) has exploded, and is now one of the most popular components of Flight Simulation in general.

Response The question of whether one mathematical (or observational) structure stands in a certain relationship to another, or whether, given a structure and a set of relational constraints formulated with respect thereto, another structure satisfying those constraints can be generated or identified in polynomial time (in a number of steps expressible as as a polynomial function of the total number of structural elements), is not the question I'm asking here...although this question can easily be related to the questions that I am asking. 

For present purposes, we might as well define an """"intractable (scientific) paradox"""" as an apparent inconsistency which is agreed to exist by experts in the relevant field(s) of science, but which those experts have failed to conclusively and consensually resolve despite their protracted efforts to do so. (Such an inconsistency can be any of several kinds.) The question of whether such paradoxes owe to a """"lack of imagination"""" on the parts of the experts """"in almost all cases"""" is thus really about the creative competence of those experts. But although it would be possible to justify some fairly negative judgments along those lines, that's still not the question I'm asking here. 

The questions I'm asking here are (1) given such an inconsistency, can you resolve it without a metalanguage of the theory or theories (and data sets) which generate it, and (2) if you own that such a metalanguage is required, is this metalanguage - i.e., a language sufficient for the full expression of the interpretative mapping M:T<>U, where T stands for a (scientific) theory and U stands for the observable universe of that theory - necessarily scientific in nature? That is, in and of itself, does such a metalanguage necessarily involve observational applications of the scientific method (as opposed to the axiomatic method)?

You go on to discuss the UV catastrophe. As we all know, the UV catastrophe was """"resolved"""" by the quantization of light, ultimately leading to the development of quantum mechanics. Unfortunately, there remains a problem with quantum mechanics: the formalism observably corresponds to reality only at limited junctures. The questions of if and how the rest of it corresponds to observable reality remain matters of widespread confusion, and have led to several conflicting interpretations of QM which are necessarily expressed in a """"philosophical"""" metalanguage of QM (which can itself be cast as a metalanguage of classical mechanics). If one of these interpretations is ever refined to the extent that it can generate new falsifiable predictions, it will become """"scientific"""". But until then, we're stuck with philosophical (observationally unfalsifiable) interpretations.

You have already identified """"imagination"""" as important in the resolution of scientifc paradoxes. This alone casts doubt on the notion that there exists any algorithm generating a valid resolution in every case. However, you still seem to believe that there is a set of principles which can be used to conclusively identify such resolutions once they are given, and more generally, to quickly and superficially distinguish between valid and invalid resolutions. Prior to encountering you, the Hillman agent, and certain others here at Wikipedia, I hadn't known of any such principles. I am therefore asking you to share these principles - as opposed to the biases, hunches, rules of thumb, and other voodoo on which others have relied - with the rest of world.

 The creator of the """"Blade Element Theory"""" is Stefan Drzewiecki and not the Wright Brothers. 

Tom Crouch, a pro Wright brother historian, claims the two US inventors realized that a propeller was in fact a rotating wing and that they discovered a method to design propellers (see 1).

(1) """"The design of effective propellers presented a far greater challenge. The Wrights, who had initially hoped to learn from experience with ship propellers, discovered that little thought had been given to basic theory in this area. In another of their brilliant flashes of insight, the brothers reasoned that a propeller could be regarded as a rotary wing in which the lift being generated becomes the thrust that moves the aircraft forward. Knowing the number of revolutions per minute at which the propeller would be turning, they calculated the speed at which the blade would be moving at any point along its length and selected an appropriate airfoil from the tables developed during their wind tunnel tests. It sounds simple enough, but as Orville explained, """"on further consideration it is hard to find even a point from which to make a start, for nothing about a propeller, or the medium in which it acts, stands still for a moment."""""""", Tom Crouch, """"First Flight: The Wright Brothers and the Invention of the Airplane"""", pag. 57, 2002, https://archive.org/stream/firstflightwrigh00crou#page/56/mode/2up 

However, the letter of Wilbur Wright to Octave Chanute (see 2) shows the two brothers had already been informed about the theory of Stefan Drzewiecki, before their alleged powered flight in Dec. 1903.

(2) Letter of Wilbur Wright to Octave Chanute
Dayton, July 2, 1903,

""""My delay in writing you was chiefly due to a desire to first obtain a clear understanding of the Drzewiecki article on screws. [2] This author's methods of thought and expression are so different from my own that it has been no easy matter to master his paper. It shows a very clear understanding of some features of the question, but as the author seems unacquainted with negative tangential, and with the effect which weight of water acted upon by each part of the screw has in fixing the angle of incidence, the paper leaves much to be desired as a complete discussion of the subject. I am quite certain that his method of constructing a screw of uniform angle of incidence will not give the result intended. The speed imparted to the water by suction before the screw actually has a chance to strike it is also ignored; and no method of calculating the loss from this source is given. Some of his conclusions seem to Orville and me to be rank heresy, but of course we are like the theologians and judge the """"soundness"""" or """"unsoundness"""" of others by the closeness of their agreement with ourselves."""", Source: http://invention.psychology.msstate.edu/inventors/i/Wrights/library/Chanute_Wright_correspond/1903/Jul2-1903.html

(3) """"[2] Stefan Drzewiecki, born in 1844, was the originator of the blade element theory of screws, which considers the blades of a screw as being composed of an infinite number of aerofoil sections. The blade element theory, together with the momentum theory of Froude and Rankine, is almost universally used today to explain the action of aerial screws. In 1900, Drzewiecki presented a paper, """"Des Helices propulsives,"""" to the Congres d'Architecture et de Constructions Navales in Paris. In 1901, a second paper by him, """"Du Choix des elements determinant les helices propulsives permettant leur facile comparaison entre elles,"""" was published in the Bulletin de l'Association Technique Maritime (no. 12, 1901). The papers were reprinted in Paris in 1900 and 1901 respectively. It is not known which of the two Chanute sent to the Wrights."""", Source: http://invention.psychology.msstate.edu/inventors/i/Wrights/library/Chanute_Wright_correspond/1903/Jul2-1903.html

These two brothers were ignorant people, they made fun of Drzewiecki in front of Chanute, and finally, in 1908 when they flew in France and US in front of witnesses, started to claim the theory of this Polish scientist as their own. Historians, like Tom Crouch, who do not have any technical background, simply believed the two brothers and propagated this false information around the world."""

- From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.

It's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. 

Good ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.

For example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.

It's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.

And too bad you didn't quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.
Good riddance!!"

 Okay that makes sense. It can be assumed younger students are looking up butter and most likely the process in which it is made, leading to the vandalism. Thanks for the info!   

Butter alternatives
In response to 's request for justification on adding a section on butter alternatives, I added statements from and links to scientific studies talking about cardiovascular benefits of substituting other things for butter as well as some layman reports by health authorities which also have published on the concept of butter alternatives.

I integrated the health history into this new butter alternatives section as well. It might be the case that a """"butter alternatives"""" article should be created independently and that various articles should link to it, but even in that case, I feel that it is merited to summarize publications on this topic in this article. Thoughts? (talk) 

Where profits are involved one must be very careful about the claims by and on behalf of competing products. We should not be implying that one product needs to be replaced with another. Listing alternatives without saying why (in that part of the article) is thus a problem. There have been many studies suggesting all sorts of things about butter and its competitors. We can report what reliable sources say about it, but cannot take a position on the matter. Also, if we imply that butter needs replacing because of alleged problems, we really need to apply equivalent standards to the alternatives. Potential problems have been found with at least some of the alternatives. To just list alternatives, thereby implying that butter is problematic, without mentioning issues with the alternatives, is unacceptable. It would probably be going too far to list ALL the issues, so I'd suggest leaving the alternatives out.   
I hesitate to take your suggestion to leave the alternatives section out entirely but I would like to respond to your concerns in some way. My first thought would be that I could fork this into an article called Butter substitution, then have the list, a health discussion, and advice from organizations about doing the substitution.
About profits - there are areas on Wikipedia where there is risk of commercial intervention but I do not see unbranded food concepts as being particularly high risk at this time. I should mention that I am sharing this information on behalf of Consumer Reports, the United States equivalent of your Australian Choice (Australian consumer organisation). We publish food and health information from the US government and medical organizations, and I came to this butter article because of our own work. My organization does have a bias which says that people should consume less fat. I would like to make a health claim here that says that health organizations commonly give the advice that people should eat less butter. I cited the Cochrane Collaboration, Mayo Clinic, National Heart Foundation of Australia, and my own organization as saying this, but to go into more detail would be as you said, undue.
How would you feel about my forking this content into its own article, putting everything there, and then keeping a statement in this article which said something like """"Many health organizations advise that consumers should use less fats in their diet and cooking and eat less butter because of the cardiovascular problems caused by the fat in many people's diets. In addition to eating less butter, these organizations recommend replacing butter with butter substitutes which are purported to have fewer adverse effects."""" I would also look for information about the health benefits of butter, if I can find any sources. How does this strike you? (talk) 

Are there no conflicting opinions, even scientific ones? Are your """"proposed"""" butter alternatives 100% harmless for all people in all situations?   
I want to assume that there at least are defined positions taken by various organizations and associated with various re"

Regarding you two non-Urantia Book reading nerds - Wazronk and Richiar - if you play games with what you don't know, then you're in for a fight. First of all, you two idiots, if you even bothered to look at the Urantia Readers-Intl website, you would know that it is not an advertising site, but a legitimate non-profit Urantia organization. Because you are not a member of the Urantia movement, and if you were, we would know who you are, you do not even know the history of the Urantia Readers-Intl - which by the way has a larger dedicated following then either the now falling apart Urantia Book Fellowship, and the failing Urantia Association International. 

For your edification, the Urantia Readers-Intl is the original Urantia Brotherhood from 1950, and the only group still holding the flame of the original Doctrine of Trust from its creation. The Urantia Book Fellowship created itself in 1989 as it broke off from the Urantia Brotherhood and the Urantia Foundation. The Foundation created another group called the Urantia Association International for some ridiculous reason, because they had the legal rights to the Urantia Brotherhood organization, and still do. Nevertheless, the Urantia Association International, as in the same direction as the Urantia Book Fellowship, fell into bad management and nefarious direction, and lost sight of the original Midwayer mandates. As such, the true remaining """"loyalist"""" migrated from the Urantia Brotherhood to the Urantia Association International. 

Over time the Urantia Association International, because of lack of true sagacity, was infiltrated by members of the rebel Urantia Book Fellowship organization. As such, the """"loyalist"""" members to the Urantia movement, many of whom where members of the Urantia Association of Florida, grabbed the torch and reorganized the original Urantia Brotherhood as the Urantia Readers-Intl. Because you two dummies are not a direct part of the Urantia movement, and again we say this because we would know who you are if you were - you do not know who is who and what is what. You don't even know that the Urantia Book Fellowship is a counter Urantia movement organization. But, you are obviously not true thinkers, but that is not the issue. 

The issue is that you two jerks keep deleting our external link from this section. We never deleted your links to the Urantia Book Fellowship, but added are link, not apparent to what place it was, but over and over we find it deleted, so now we have game on... you delete us, we delete you. So, if you put the Urantia Book Fellowship link back in, and keep ours in, the we keep yours in. Because you've pissed us off, if you place the Urantia Book Fellowship link above us, we will place our link above you. This is in retrospect to your piousness. So suffer with it. That's life, and perhaps maybe one of you two idiots will someday realize who the Urantia Readers-Intl really is, who the Urantia Book Fellowship really is, and who is the original group with the original doctrine - but we already know that you two bozos don't have what it takes to figure this out in this life time. The truce is... Urantia Readers-Intl first, Urantia Book Fellowship second, Urantia Association International third... at least for now, then maybe someday we'll swap order, just to appease the dark side. But for now this better be it, or we're going to go back and forth with you wimps and beat you at your own game. Capishe?  02:53, 29"""

0,"""==Some tips to help you out!==
Hi , I thought I'd drop a few notes on your talk page with some help on writing articles o)

First of all, it may be best for you to do a bit of reading, starting with the Wikipedia manual of style, which will give you a lot of information about how Wikipedia prefers its articles to be written.  It's not as hard to follow as it might look; quite a bit of the information there probably won't be vital for you at first.

Second, I recommend you make a user sandbox - which is just an area you can use to practise in, and to make notes in, and to get things ready in.  If you click this red link: user:/Sandbox, that will let you create that page (it gives you an edit window to start work in).  Anything, anywhere, on the help and information pages which gives you an example, try it out in your sandbox until you're familiar with it.

For your article, the next thing you want to do is start collecting as much information as you can about it.  Google searches (particularly in Books and Scholar) will be your best friend for this!  Once you've found the information, the next most important thing is to start writing up each fact in your own words (very important, this), and make a note at the same time of exactly where that information came from.  Build in the references as you go along; I'm going to copy in, down below this, a whole heap of help on doing references, which was produced by one of our best teachers ().

Here's another place that you'll find incredibly useful - citation templates which you can copy and paste into your sandbox, between  tags; you just fill in the blanks from your sources into the template, and you'll end up with nicely formatted inline citations o)  It all helps.  Remember to add a references section to your sandbox (make a new line, and put ==References== on it, and type {{reflist}} on the next line, so that you can see how your citations look as you do them.  Remember to save your page often! You don't want to lose your work.

Hopefully this will give you a good start and make life easier for you.

One last thing to keep as a motto: """"It's better to write one good, well-referenced, nicely-presented article than it is to create fifty unreferenced one-line stubs!""""  (talk …stalk!) 
How references work

 Simple references 

These require two parts;

a)
Chzz is 98 years old. """"The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 

He likes tea.  [http://www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com Tea website] 

b) A section called """"References"""" with the special code """"{{reflist}}"""";
== References ==
{{reflist}}

(an existing article is likely to already have one of these sections)

To see the result of that, please look at user:chzz/demo/simpleref. Edit it, and check the code; perhaps make a test page of your own, such as user:/reftest and try it out.

 Named references 

Chzz was born in 1837. 
""""The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 
 

Chzz lives in Footown.

Note that the second usage has a / (and no closing ref tag). This needs a reference section as above; please see user:chzz/demo/namedref to see the result.

 Citation templates 

You can put anything you like between  and , but using citation templates makes for a neat, consistent look;

Chzz has 37 Olympic medals.  {{Citation
 | last = Smith
 | first = John
 | title = Olympic medal winners of the 20th century
 | publication-date = 2001
 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]
 | page = 125
 | isbn = 0-521-37169-4
}}


Please see user:chzz/demo/citeref to see the result.

For more help and tips on that subject, see user:chzz/help/refs.

Speedy deletion of Sameer Chhabra

This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

The first two have since been kept, but the third one was quickly taken out, but I was alright with that happening, since I assume the person who removed it figured that because he is listed under """"Predacons"""" and """"Vehicons"""", his status as a villain is already there (since both the article for Vehicon and the article for Predacon are listeed under """"Villain groups""""), and so actually listing Megatron as a villain would be completely redundant.

There can't be a double standard here, I don't think.  I really think that this Megatron should indeed  be listed under the category """"Animation villains"""".  I really don't think that saying he is simply a Predacon or a Vehicon is enough, as really he was far more than that, particularly in Beast Machines, where it actually seems that calling him a Vehicon is erroneous.  I mean, he created the Vehicons, and led them, but I don't think he really was one himself, no matter what form he was in.

 Pontic Greeks 

I removed the parapgraph which stated that Trabzon still has  asizable Pontic Greek population """"As Muslims were not deported afterthe treaty of Lausanne"""".  This just isn't true.  There are no Pontic Greeks left in Trabzon.  Also Pontic Greeks are not Muslim they are Orthodox Christian.  I suspect that whoever wrote this paragraph must have been thinking about the Laz, who are Muslim, and who speak Lazca and who certainly should be mentioned in this article.  There are people who believe that the Laz are related ethnically to the Pontic Greeks, but my understanding is that this has been disproven. 

FYI, the Laz are a very sizable minority group along the Black Sea Coast, and their language is very widely spoken, though as a rule younger generations are bilingual.  Ethnically they are not Turkic, but one has to understand that """"Turk"""" in modern day Turkey is less about ethnicity than it is about national identity.  You can be of Laz, Circassian, Greek or whatever ethnic background but still be Turkish.

0,"I always thought that the shunt diodes were needed. The conceptual model that one diode is on during each half cycle, shorting out the corresponding cap isn't quite right.  What really happens is that the node between the two caps gets charged up (or down, depending on whether the + or - ends are connected together) and stays charged, so that both caps are biased with sufficient dc that their voltage never goes negative.  The reliable source we have cited there (app note from a cap manufacturer) says that you don't really need the diodes, because the caps will act as diodes and conduct in the reverse direction to accomplish that effect.  I would think it would be more reliable to have that reversed current flow through a diode, but given that it's only a transient phenomenon as the cap charges up I can see that in some applications it could be acceptable to do it without the diodes."

Hi Sam,

My name is Keith D. Foote. I'm the author of a treatise titled the Ultra-Space Field Theory. Every once in a while I google the USF theory to see if its found a home on any new websites. I came across a message from someone warning a Wikipedian writer to stop pushing the Ultra-Space Field Theory and that all future references would be sent to Melchoir. 

The Ultra-Space Field theory is an alternative model to the current particle theory paradigm and is generally ignored by the scientific community, so I'm not surprised your organization wants nothing to do with it. (My own brother, with a Bachelors in Science, called it 'whacked', though he could find no fault with its conclusions.) From what I can tell, it is a historical truth that scientists (being the busy people they are) detest new science models. Many of the assumptions in physics we currently hold as truth took decades to overcome locked mindsets. For example, a huge number of physicists describe magnetic fields as an illusion, though there is no evidence supporting this conclusion and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from billions of electrons being ejected by the Sun every minute. 

I would like to request Melchoir be given an opportunity to read the treatise. If Melchoir will e-mail me a snail mail address, I would be happy to send him a copy.

I can be reached at patienthunter@netscape.net

Thanks,

Sincerely,

Keith D. Foote"

Hello,

Thank you so much for the message.  I now completely understand the one update that you deleted on the Consumer Affairs site, to which you left me a message on my talk page.  But, I also see (through looking at the page history) for my other additions to the Ambit page where the accolades were taken down without providing me with an understanding of how it violated Wiki.  I saw the comment for the works cited to the newsvideos and now understand that possibly news casts available on YouTube are not allowed.  My question is this: if it is ok to input criticism of a company into it's wiki page, why not the awards and milestones that it has achieved (from independent sources who were properly cited)?  I am dumbfounded as to how one side, but not the other can be properly added and cited.  I do believe that it is paramount in Wiki to have a NPOV and I now realize after reading your comment on my Talk page that I could have used better verbiage.  Could you please point me in the right direction on how to properly add and cite recognition that a company receives vs criticism?  I have combed through several of the neutral POV topics that you have mentioned in others' comments, but I could not find an answer to my question.  Thank you in advance for your help."

 Boxer Rebellion/ Righteous Harmony Society 

Question about the Nov 10 undo of my merge of Righteous Harmony Society into Boxer Rebellion. 

Sorry if I appeared not to discuss, but I thought I was following the instructions on how to merge. I put a brief explanation on the Boxer Rebellion Talk page, since there was no longer a Righteous Harmony Society Talk page to post on. My reason was that the RH article was a stub, had misleading information, was unsourced, and that it was part of the narrative of the BR article. No reason has been given for the undo except that editors """"might"""" want to expand it.

Also sorry that I took so long to reply, but the undo of the merge was only labeled """"cleanup,"""" which didn't seem to describe the action taken.   """

 Merger proposal 

Basically both articles describe the same thing/process. For me, """"devoré"""" is the term that most fashion/textiles people use or know, although """"burnout"""" is also used quite often for the same process. However, I would suggest burnout (textiles) is preferable to the current Burnout (clothing) title of the other page if """"burnout"""" is deemed more appropriate than """"devoré"""". They certainly need merging, although the question is, should Devoré or an alternative Burnout page with a more appropriate title be the new home for the information? My vote is for """"devoré"""" as the term less likely to cause confusion.   """

It is also accurate to say that area has no extent - just like a point or line. Area only begins to take on understandable dimensions once a point or line is assigned extent. As an example: If a line is made up of 3 points of zero extent, it's length is zero. If it is made up of 3 points whose centers are half a unit from the circumference of a circle formed around the same, then the line has length of 3 units.

Please see this thread and consider giving new page creators some breathing room before tagging their pages for deletion. In this case, you tagged within 2 minutes of creation. Unless it's an attack page or something, give the editor some time to work with the article. Thanks, –xenotalk 
Admittedly I was on the fence in regards to this article and perhaps should have simply tagged it for improvement or as a stub. I allowed my review of the creator's block log to skew my opinion on an unreferenced bio. And I realize I misunderstood the inapplicability of G4's to speedy deletes.
But in general, as a NP patroller I feel that my purpose is to filter pages on creation.  With the volume of speedy deletes we generate, there are going to be occasional disputes regarding our reasoning.  However, in the vast majority these proposals for deletion are necessary soon after creation or the article will be lose the benefit of input from an experienced editor unless someone on recent changes happens to notice the article as it is being modified. If bad articles slip past this initial screening I feel it would increase the workload of the pool of editors as a whole.

Serbian casualties again

Just one link more, to the already existing ones numbered above: http://www.aimpress.ch/dyn/trae/archive/data/199711/71128-026-trae-beo.htm 
It is perfectly understandable for Serbian apologists to try to minimize the Serbian death toll (in battles- civilian Serbian casualties are, as usual, inflated beyond & beyond..). The reason ? High military casualties figure speaks of Serbian military incompetence (as contrasted to their self-image of a Ramboid nation); also, it is a sign of heavy Yugoslav involvement in agression on Croatia. Anyone's national sensibilities aside-it is clear that all realiable and available sources put the Serbian military death toll at the lowest level of 8.000.  

The article is signed by Stipe Sikavica (a typical Croatian name) so it again represents a Croatian press POV.

Here's another nice example of nationalist logic. What you're basically saying is that this journalist cannot possibly be objective because he is Croatian, is that it? Infact, you are drawing this conclusion solely out of the man's NAME. What if he changed his name, maybe he would be more neutral then, what do you think?  

Even in that link you could not see that anyone from serbian side states something like 10.000.
According to Serbian sources regarding the number of Serbian soldiers who died or went missing during all the wars in Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the number often mentioned is 2,300., and most of them, around a half, are believed to have died in the battle for Vukovar. The cited article states also that """"most experts agree with the figure"""". 
There are no reason to put 8.000 or 10.000 as official data. These data are contraversial. 
Croatian sources, ie. general Anton Tus, put the Serbian military casualties figure around 10.000. Other sources, like brigadier general Mile Dedaković, in his book """"Bitka za Vukovar"""", put the highest limit around 12.000. Therefore, chief Croatian estimates revolve around 10 k Serbian military casualties. This page is not about what Serbian sources say-exclusively. Without going into details of questionable veracity of Serbian sources re this battle, the most correct approach is to state what both sides have to say. And, in the cited article by a journalist named Sikavica, it is clear for anyone who is not deaf, blind and mute that some Serbian military figures agree with general Tus's estimates. It is explicit. Therefore, reverted.  

I've seen this later

It's not just the number of Serbian military casualties (after all, these were mainly puzzled conscripts sent to the slaughterhouse). It's this sick worldview prevalent in some Serbian circles: Croatian paramilitaries, secession, liberation of Vukovar,...then liberation of Srebrenica, faked Markala, lies about everything and everyone (for those conversant with Croatian, just a slice: http://www.hic.hr/books/jugoistocna-europa/dedijer.htm#kraj%20mita).

Once again, I disagree on all counts. It should be PATENTLY obviously to anyone reading about vaginoplasty and metoidioplasty surgery whose purpose is the creation of a vagina or a penis, that it is about the vagina and genitalia in a surgical context and that therefore photos of the surgery will of necessity include photos of the vagina or the penis as is relevant to the surgical procedure. The graphic is entirely editorial, and unfairly demonstrates a bias on the part of an author that is unfair and un called for in this context. I believe such notices set a socially incorrect precedent that should be reversed. Such notices are inappropriate in a medical context. An encyclopedia for the world should not """"cau tau"""" to the overly prudish, biased, morees of certain absurdly puritanical cultures.

Here is what I wrote and said so far

""""Top news on al Jazeera and in the Arab world, the officially dubbed

is a high indicator of storms to come. The Security General had ruled
Syrian occupied Lebanon for almost two decades. His knowledge of the
intelligence and terrorism web is boundless. Some sources in Syria and
Lebanon, reacting to the news this morning called the death, an
""""assisted suicide."""" Kanaan, according to these sources knew
""""significantly"""" about the assassins of former Prime Minister Hariri. He
""""committed"""" suicide as the time President Assad would be addressing
world opinion and the American public via CNN."""" Walid Phares

Phares on al Hurra TV: """"Syria: General Kanaan's """"assisted"""" suicide?""""
Phares on al Hurra TV: """"General Ghazi Kanaan was the security ruler of
Syrian-occupied Lebanon for decades. He has ordered executions, torture,
transfer to Syrian prisons and has been in the center of Syrian
connections with Terrorist regimes and organization for 30 years. He
knew mountains of information on Terror and crimes executed in Lebanon
and the region. He was on the UN commission's list of high suspects in
the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri. His suicide was
most likely """"assisted.""""

Lebanon. Maybe it was payback for the assassination? I am going to

0,""" is known as the al'Buraq wall to Muslims. I do not doubt in any way that is is known by this name by many Muslims, particularly some Palestinian and Jordanian Muslims. However, from everything that I've read, the name is of rather recent provenance, and was never known as such among Muslims until the foundation of modern Israel. If memory serves, it didn't really have any circulation until the last two decades or so.  from the obscure claims of Mujir al'Din that the Buraq was left there when Mohammad ascended to paradise, which itself is a legend derived from Sahih al'Bukhari, the provenance of the hadith itself being regarded by some as an addition of a later editor; that's of little relevance here, though. I see this has been mentioned on the talk page already in passing, and I don't advocate any necessity of removing it. However, the attribution itself is sixteenth century, and actual naming of it as the """"al'Buraq wall"""" is incredibly recent. I think we should at the very least clarify this, add another source aside from an obviously politically motivated fatwa for the name, and perhaps move it somewhere besides the lead so we can elaborate on all of this. I just skimmed it, but I'm not even sure the fatwa actually names it as such aside from the title (nevermind, it does). For all I know, it may itself be the origin of the name, with this article helping to disseminate it. Since this, like every Jerusalem-related article, is contentious, I thought it best to get some discussion before I did anything.   

Yes, its a point of contention. See above, it is discussed both in the """"Lead"""" subsection of the """"POV Issues"""" section and in the """"Rashid Khalidi"""" section.  

Jordanian occupation 1948–1967
I was wondering, from whom did the Jordanian capture the old city of Al-Quds and the wall? and why was the Jordanian rule over it considered occupation, while Israeli rule is considered sovereignty? I don't find this neutral? This should be changed.   
The answer is in the article.  
It is referred to as the Jordanian Occupation, because their annexation of the site was not internationally recognised, hence occupation. And while Israel's presence is also not recognised, (the last UN resolution on the matter calls for Jerusalem to be internationalised), in reality, Israel excercises its sovreignty over the site. As this matter is disputed, I did want to add a section on the current legal status of the wall and suggestions mooted during peace negotiations relating to future ownership of the site, but I could not find any good sources.   
Jordan exercised its sovereignty over the wall for the period they controlled it, i think both should be changed to sovereignty or occupation. The Israeli rule is not internationally recognised either and if I'm not incorrect then the Western wall and old city were part of the West bank. Which is under occupation.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 90.193.16.207   
Jerusalem is viewed differently from the West Bank. See Positions on Jerusalem and Occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem by Jordan. This subject matter is so extensive and there are so many diverse """"postions"""" on the subject, I am not really qualified to determine the correct descriptions. But for the sake of neutrality, I believe Yamanam does have a valid point. Even though the artricle on Jordan's rule calls it occupation, I suggest changing both to """"rule"""" which would hopefuly solve the problem.   
Yes i belive that could be an acceptable compromise. i would prefer it if you did it as edits by account members are more respectable.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 90.193.16.207

Vandalism warning
One or more of the children of Sonja de Lennart appear to have engaged in a lengthy hoax, beginning around December 2007, to convince the world that their mother was a famous designer in the 1940s and 1950s (although a Google search reveals no references in any fashion or other reputable sources until 2008), including vandalism of numerous Wikipedia articles (Emilio Pucci and Capri pants articles were vandalized).

Recent news articles on Capri pants have picked up the false information (the Wikipedia article on Capri pants has been duplicated on answers.com and other reference sites), and these are being used to further the hoax.  

The """"official website"""" of Sonja De Lennart was created by her daughter, Eleonora De Lennart, in February 2008, and was serving as the """"reputable source"""" for the claim that Sonja De Lennart created Capri pants (heretofore generally attributed to Emilio Pucci) until the news articles came up in June 2008.

Users Pchip and Delennart are the two Wikipedia IDs responsible for this hoax - user Delennart began repeatedly vandalizing the Emilio Pucci and Capri pants pages on December 30, 2007 to insert references to Sonja De Lennart as the creator of Capri pants, and after other Wikipedia users instructed her that the discussion of Sonja De Lennart was not appropriate on the Emilio Pucci page, user Delennart stopped contributing to Wikipedia and user Pchip suddenly appeared in February 2008 to further vandalize the Capri pants page and to create the hoax page for Sonja De Lennart.

In any case Depardieu has not renounced French citizenship

Seriously, i don't know why i even try. Next you know, all newspapers are """"rags"""" and diplomatic sources such as the Kremlin website are not reliable... Oh wait... We already went to that stage. -  
 As I explained above, the Daily Mail  - a notoriously unreliable English newspaper - 's article is from 20 December and is talking about the earlier controversy about Depardieu saying he was going to renounce French nationality.  It was impossible for this to be true since he did not have any other nationality to fall back on.    

Alledgely claims by Depardieu's Agent

Will the honourable gentleman behind IP 87.67.143.211 post ANY KIND OF SOURCE to back his claim, or will you just continue vandalizing the article and removing content and references? -  

Depardieu is a French actor having his legal residence in Belgium. That's all for the moment

1. France did not remove Depardieu's citizenship yet (otherwise, where is the source?).

2. Depardieu never applied for Russian citizenship.

3. Ask your Prof. of International Law (I did).

4. See here: http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/filmstar-gerard-depardieu-von-putin-zum-russen-ernannt-a-875537.html): “Die Formulierung des Kreml, wonach Depardieu einen Antrag auf Einbürgerung gestellt hatte, wurde von einem Assistenten des Schauspielers dementiert.“

In English: The formulation of the Kremlin, that Depardieu had filed an application for naturalization, was denied by an assistant of the actor.

So yes: the Kremlin lied.

5. Lock this article once and for all for the rest of the month.

6. Ask yourself: If tomorrow, every country of the world offer Depardieu a passport, what do you do? Will you consider he's a Afghanisto-Albanio-Algerio-Andorro-Angolo-Antiguo-Barbudo-Argentino-Armenio-Australio-Austrio-Azerbaijo-Bahamo-Bahro-Banglado-Barbado-Belaro-Belgo-Belizo-Benino-Bhutano-Bolivio-………-Zambio-Zimbabwean actor?

 Replaceable fair use Image:Osfpchamps.jpg 

Thanks for uploading Image:Osfpchamps.jpg. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:

 Go to the image description page and edit it to add , without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template.
 On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on [ this link]. Note that fair use images which could be replaced by free-licensed alternatives will be deleted 7 days after this notification, per our Fair Use policy.  If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you.  """

NIELN is one of the axe grinding editors that advance an agenda of non neutrality, edit warring, 3 R reverting, vandalism that are all forbidden by Wikipedia rules.

0,"That statement is the only thing I cannot believable about the Pirate Bay trial.  I hope they win the trial but there is no way they operate at a loss.  My friend operates a website that draws 500000 people per month on average.  With the same or less ad coverage as pirate bay, he earns 1 US dollar for every thousand visitors.  For pirate bay, this equates to 1 thousand dollars for every visitor they have.  They claim 25 million active members, so figure a lower number of 5-10 million per day.  This brings in as high as $10000 per day if I'm staying conservative.  This is not counting donations and likely better ad deals due to the large numbers of people being drawn and time of each person spent on the website (ie, multiple hits by a person per day).  So the amount of money being drawn in per day has a lower limit of 10 grand.  365 days in a year, unless these people are complete morons they should be bringing in at least a million per year gross income.  More likely several million.  With these numbers, if they only get a million hits per day, which is well within everyone's, including piratebay's, estimations, then they would still be making on the order of $365000 per year.  There is no way operational costs equal or exceed this value even if they bought brand new servers every other year, which doesn't seem logical given my knowledge of networking.
Now they might be incorporating expansion costs, ie the new server banks in Russia and other countries, and other related costs to expansion in costs of business when saying they operate at a loss.  Hate to break it to ya, this means they're just spending money they already earned.  So yes, they do in fact earn that much money, they just spend it as fast as they earn it.

I feel that I have to add something. Please note that the temporary solution defines Kosovo as a territory of Serbia and Montenegro under UN administration. Note that it's not defined as a part of Serbia, but the Union rather. This is mostly because they anticipated the future most probable status of Kosovo, a state within the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. 

However, you must realize that Serbia's (and the Union's) consitution defines Kosovo as an autonomous region, temporary under UN administration. The current borders of Serbia (and SCG) are internationally recognized and used everywhere (with Kosovo-Metohija). However, Kosovo is nowhere treated as an entity indistinct from Serbia (and most definatly not indistinct from the S-M), as no faction in the world sees it that way. I suggest that a possible compromise is that we should add that the Kosovar Albanian goverment refuses the Belgrade suzeiranity and considers it not a part of Serbia, and then the other side of the story (Serbia & the world), however, pointing it not an official part of Serbia and Montenegro is, francly, I apologize for the expression, but it is, really nonsensical.

There are only two ways to write months: long form, and short form.
Long form: Months мај, јун, јул, maj, jun, jul + јуни, јули, juni, juli (besides other 9+9 i.e. 18 ones) all belong in long_months. That’s resolved.
Short form: short_months must all have dot (they’re all the dotted short names) except famous 6 (or 10 if you count јуни, јули, juni, juli which are variants for јун, јул, jun, jul, respectively). We don’t use """"мај."""", """"јун."""", """"јул."""", """"maj."""", """"jun."""", """"jul."""" because there are already existing long forms in that shape (""""мај"""", """"јун"""", """"јул"""", """"maj"""", """"jun"""", """"jul""""), and if we abbreviate """"јуни"""", """"јули"""", """"juni"""", """"juli"""" as """"јун."""", """"јул."""", """"jun."""", """"jul."""" we did it illegally because there are already """"јун"""", """"јул"""", """"jun"""", """"jul"""" as long forms that cannot be abbreviated (and are used in Serbian much much more often than јуни, јули, juni, juli).
So, yes: dot is ALWAYS required for short month names except for my famous 6 with extra 4 mentioned above (famous 10 in total).

What you’have presumed is almost 100% correct, and code above should be actually 100% correct. Taking into account my two definitions above for long form and short form it’s like this, I suppose:
 long names of varying lengths; not shortened versions
local long_months = {['јануар']=1, ['фебруар']=2, ['март']=3, ['април']=4, ['мај']=5, ['јун']=6, ['јуни']=6, ['јул']=7, ['јули']=7, ['август']=8, ['септембар']=9, ['октобар']=10, ['новембар']=11, ['децембар']=12, ['januar']=1, ['februar']=2, ['mart']=3, ['april']=4, ['maj']=5, ['jun']=6, ['juni']=6, ['jul']=7, ['juli']=7, ['avgust']=8, ['septembar']=9, ['oktobar']=10, ['novembar']=11, ['decembar']=12};

 short names all three characters; these do not use terminal period
local short_months = {['мај']=5, ['јун']=6, ['јул']=7, ['maj']=5, ['jun']=6, ['jul']=7};

 short names all three characters; these require terminal period
local dot_months = {['јан']=1, ['феб']=2, ['мар']=3, ['апр']=4, ['авг']=8, ['сеп']=9, ['окт']=10, ['нов']=11, ['дец']=12, ['jan']=1, ['feb']=2, ['mar']=3, ['apr']=4, ['avg']=8, ['sep']=9, ['okt']=10, ['nov']=11, ['dec']=12};

Only changes are extra , ['јун']=6 and , ['јул']=7 for local long_months, and is_valid_month_range_style() should do the job perfectly.

It can be equaled to December–June 2014 which might be December 2013 – June 2014 or December 2014 – June 2015. Winter–Spring 2014 is still ambiguos in my opinion, and dates for solstices and eqinoxes don’t change that by  values they have at the moment (which are going to change in the very far future because Earth does not travel along the same path every year; it changes for sure but for 10–I don’t know really meters).

Your request for rollback

Hi Jeffrd10.  After reviewing your request for rollback, I have enabled rollback on your account.  Keep in mind these things when going to use rollback:
Getting rollback is no more momentous than installing Twinkle.
Rollback should be used to revert clear cases of vandalism only, and not good faith edits.
Rollback should never be used to edit war.
If abused, rollback rights can be revoked.
Use common sense.
If you no longer want rollback, contact me and I'll remove it.  Also, for some more information on how to use rollback, see Wikipedia:New admin school/Rollback (even though you're not an admin).  I'm sure you'll do great with rollback, but feel free to leave me a message on my talk page if you run into troubles or have any questions about appropriate/inappropriate use of rollback.  Thank you for helping to reduce vandalism.  Happy editing!   """

Speedy deletion of Thrice Scene
 A tag has been placed on Thrice Scene requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for web content. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the article does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that a copy be emailed to you.   —   """

 ex-Yugoslav yellow house connection 

You may remember the resignation of Ms. Carla del Ponte, the UN's chief investigator for former Yugoslavia war crimes. She resigned after she learned the kosovan alban militants culled 300 cage-held serbian civilians and POWs and sold their organs to Turkey.

She was prevented from pursuing this """"Yellow House atrocity"""" case any further, because serbs were the NATO pre-assigned evil and kosovans were the designated """"friends of the democracy"""" at the time. Yet, the serb gov't promised to investigate it further and avenge on the perpetrators, including the ethnic alban master terrorirst Hasim Tachi.

After seeing someone else have that interest and defend it I am convinced that it is indeed a worthy service and that I shouldn't feel bad for giving it its due attention. There's not nearly enough attention given to page titles on Wikipedia, and people don't seem to understand the role a title plays in the framing of an article and how people perceive that article and its content. When it comes to move requests, most seem to degenerate into vague debates about google results, or obscure sources from google which provide that one exception that some people will cling to with tooth and nail to avoid a change they don't like. I believe strongly that we need more people who are willing to read, understand, and interpret the rules in a consistent manner and to not merely vote up or down on a page name based off raw search engine results or their own pre-conceptions of fairness and neutrality.

Of course atheism is a religion: it attempts to answer all the big questions that other religions do, and is based on a metaphysical claim incapable of empirical proof.  But you can quibble about what """"religion"""" means all you want, because the fact remains that theistic religions and atheism are all worldviews.

Many evolutionists disagree that evolution has nothing to do with atheism.  E.g. Dawkins said that Darwmin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist, and Provine claimed that a religion was compatible with evolution only if it was for all practical purposes indistinguishable from atheism.

 Not sure why we beat around the bush in not just saying she was crushed by a bulldozer 

All three of the first three sources cited about the cause of her death (the film Occupation 101, The Guardian, and Time) state that she was killed by a bulldozer, whether you want to call it an accident or not. Trying to reference which aspect of being bulldozed, such as """"debris"""" falling from the bulldozer, as the IDF reworded it, is a way of psychologically distancing the person operating the bulldozer for the IDF from having any direct responsibility for the action. None of the three sources state it was caused by """"debris."""" So the source citations should be moved closer to the statement that the witnesses said she was caught """"underneath."""" Currently the three citations have been placed next to a phrase that none of them reference. Therefore the sentence should be broken into two parts. The part about the IDF referencing """"debris"""" should have whatever citation mentions it next to that sentence, but none of the three sources cited references debris at all. 

Here is what they do say:

1. http://occupiedpalestine.wordpress.com/2010/12/26/occupation-101-full-movie-in-11-parts/  Part 6 of 7 after about 7:41, the film Occupation 101 (2006) states """"she got caught underneath the bulldozer""""; """"When Rachel Corrie was killed, she was protecting a doctor's home""""; """"The U.S. Congress has refused her parents' request for an independent investigation in her murder.""""  This source said nothing about debris accidentally falling on her. 

2. """"Corrie, 23, was crushed to death by an army bulldozer in Rafah, Gaza, as she protested against house demolitions."""" -The Guardian. This newspaper simply states she was """"crushed to death by the bulldozer.""""

3. """"Rachel Corrie was a 23-year-old American from Olympia, Wash., who was crushed to death by an Israeli Army bulldozer March 16, 2003. Corrie was in the Gaza Strip, working with the International Solidarity Movement, which opposes Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and living among Palestinians whose homes were being demolished. She was kneeling in front of a home, acting as a human shield, when she was bulldozed."""" - Time.     
Again, here we are told she was """"crushed to death"""" and """"bulldozed."""" Nothing about debris accidentally falling.

I or someone else should put the citations next to a phrase about the bulldozer killing her. How exactly it killed her (whether dropping stuff on her or rolling over her) is speculative. None of the three sources reference debris. If the IDF """"debris"""" statement must be included it should be a separate sentence. The IDF operated the machine and have a potential self protection conflict of interest in their wording.

I'd feel better if it said something like: 

""""She was crushed by a bulldozer's operations clearing land in front of a Palestinian doctor's home.[1,2,3] An IDF investigation reported she died after being struck by falling debris.[source??]""""

(More accurate for the IDF part of it would be """"by debris falling from the bulldozer."""" I'd probably rather it say the IDF """"claimed"""" rather than """"reported"""" but I'm not going to change that part.)

According to the procedures, a """"clear, substantial, and active consensus of uninvolved editors"""" is required to overturn an arbitration enforcement action. To help determine any such consensus, involved editors may make brief statements in separate sections but should not edit the section for discussion among uninvolved editors. Editors are normally considered involved if they are in a current dispute with the sanctioning or sanctioned editor, or have taken part in disputes (if any) related to the contested enforcement action. Administrators having taken administrative actions are not normally considered involved for this reason alone (see WP:UNINVOLVED).

We already know you alone claimed the first link was spam and you removed it on that basis. Even users who don’t think the link should have been there agreed it was not spam. So your poor judgment is not in doubt. Your following days of rant showed your true reason for not wanting the link, it was because you didn’t like the idea of the site also selling hotel rooms. The link to the visitor centre is still there by the way, which shows it was regarded as being a legitimate item to link to. My point still remains that if its worth linking to the first link was far more useful to the general public.

Thank you for adding the info: What you've just done is more than they have accomplished in the last year for us oddly enough since this law passed. Now we have something to point to when we create all our lovely links ;) Total sweetness, thanks again  

Signed up for the group, got your message ) Thanks much! See you there!

FYI, Insurance Discrimination was one of the top 3 things we won with HB 2661. I noticed the new page others created and was delighted. I did however make one addition and added insurance. This is a major issue for transgender persons especially everywhere; access to medical care free from discrimination ;)  

'Legislative History' and 'Fiscal Notes' external links added today to HB 2661 in regards to the historic legislature which passed here in WA State. This law includes a group of persons with unique needs and issues; Fiscal allocation/requests for support are relevant whereas civil rights law enforcement support is concerned.  

Just wanted to thank you for your continued efforts with HB 2661!  

Allie, i wanted to ask for your help with something. I uploaded an image and am not sure how to label it... please view my info page and you will see... I submitted a question to wiki but i know you are smart so i figured i'd ask you too ~   (ps. I love the new pic ;)

 Kaikolas cannot be classifed by the Aryan Varna caste system 

Kaikolars cannot be classified by the  Aryan Varna caste system. This is similar to putting a Arab or Jew or African or Chinese into Kshatriya, Vysya, etc. The  Aryan Varna caste system is only for Aryans. Kaikolans are tamilians.

Which language group belong to ARYA VARNA CASTE SYSTEM?

Pakistanis?

 Pallava are Brahmin 

Pallavas are brahmins. They have made many inscriptions claiming that they are are brahmins of Bharadvaja gotra. Hence Pallavas are not considered as tamil kings.

Then what happened to the decendants of the Pallava kings in Tamil Nadu?

Pallavas never claimed as brahmans at the start of their power. Later only some Pallavas left some inscriptions as they belonged to Bharadwaja Gothra.

The early Pallavas belonged to Nanthi gothra. Pallavas used NANTHI (BULL) their emblem. Kaikolans are still belong to NANTHI GOTHRA.

I hope the pius DEVADASI system became a system of only dancing and prostitution after the demise of the PALLAVA empire.

I agree there is a certain repetition between that and the GAA section. But it's a bit different spin at issue. At least as the anon editor presents it, the Barsamian interview is used in relation to Churchill's own ethnicity. The GAA section is about scholarly disagreements on the meaning of the Act. Moreover, while we have a quote in the GAA where Churchill affirms his belief, this quote is more specific in describing Churchill's interpretation. Maybe we should add a note like """"see also below section"""" to make the connection.

Which of the places on the list are notable enough for separate articles (if they don't have one now)?  I've added links to articles where I could them.  I'd say articles are also needed at least for Sugar Creek,  Red Butte, Rocky Ridge, Echo Canyon, and Emigration Canyon.  A couple of points of interest that could be added are Genoa, Nebraska (settled by the Latter-day Saints as a supply point) and This Is The Place Heritage Park.  I'm sure other landmarks will be identified with additional research.
Which places could be reasonably combined in sections, like the eastern Wyoming sites? Some suggested sections:  Iowa (mostly covering the 1840s); the Missouri River area (Winter Quarters / Kanesville / Florence); Missouri River to Fort Laramie; For Laramie to Fort Bridger (with a focus on the handcart companies); and Fort Bridger to Salt Lake Valley.  The Iowa section could include a brief subsection on the route used by the handcart companies from Iowa City to Florence.
And how are we to deal with elapsed time, as early companies had different experiences than later companies?  One chunk for geography and another for linear time? I think the organization of the Mormon Trail article should focus on geography.  Content that is intrinsically chronological could be moved to the Mormon Pioneer article.  Would it make sense to tackle both of these articles at once to try to ensure that they compliment each other without simply being repetitive?—"

I agree with Demiurge1000. Stanistani, please lift the ban on the account """"bryansee"""" on Wikipediocracy.com. I have no intention of posting what you unilaterally deem as unsuitable material. And you don't aware that the clear signal sent by admins on behalf of BatteryIncluded have a ripple effect throughout the Internet. You don't seem to distinguish the meaning of life and death of people on the Internet. And don't do anything to harm/destroy my computer with input device-disabling malware. Let me make myself clear about Wikipedia:

 The administrators and editors alike have turned Wikipedia into an online totalitarian regime, and no one has done a darn thing about it if they don't want to be immediately killed, beaten or received intimidating death threats. BatteryIncluded, Dennis Brown, AGK, and Boing! said Zebedee are said to be a part of them. They tend to use misleading and incivil statements as credible, accurate and correct. They also tend to use personal attacks and outs people as well. This is why they hate them as well.
 This explains cabalism in Wikipedia as well.
 This explains the unevenly enforced, extreme and heavy-handed rules enacted by the Wikipedia community, BatteryIncluded is such a prime example. Others outside Wikipedia really want to worship these rules as well - BatteryIncluded's ally """"forcedmemefred"""" is the first one - trying to protect Wikipedia from external harassment.
 Wikipedia editors, such as  died last April in a rock-climbing accident. Although a loss for Wikipedia, her death might have been deemed by the Wikipedia community as a """"human sacrifice""""; BatteryIncluded and his people perceived it as she's """"well"""", meaning that she has cured her paranoia. This may apply to me and you as well, as we have signed separate death warrants. I think I have to say that, any increase in their medication dose will not cure paranoia, instead it will be deadly to people. I guess that Wikipedia is not the only one, but also Wikipediocracy (by  as Zoloft), Encyclopedia Dramatica and Know Your Meme (via forcedmemefred).
 I think this is the fate that you are going to face later on, especially you are taking actions therein that are aimed at Wikipedia, just as what I've did.
 And, these events have signalled a neo-luddite sentiment against computers and other devices that has the capability to connect to a network given these events, namely computers being the cause of people's paranoia deemed by BatteryIncluded, forcedmemefred and his subordinates. Given the fact Wikipedia is being used to spread malicious code and has the tendency of giving people malware, this is the case for BatteryIncluded as he does to the computers of many users he is dealing with.
 BatteryIncluded is really the worst one I've ever seen on the Internet.
 He gives people kittens. """"Kittens"""" may be a bomb with a intimidating death therat. The kitten that BatteryIncluded sent me might be a bomb. And  is thought by BatteryIncluded to contain kittens.
 He has the reputation of distorting people's histories.
 He has the reputation of sacrificing humans via increase in their medication, as well as making death threats in the guise of """"seeing a doctor/therapist"""" advices, as well as inciting neo-luddism against computers.
 He is the source of inspiration of admins and activist alike making personal attacks and acting unilaterally to ban people.
 Every page on Wikipedia is outrightly misleading, and """"truth"""" is based on whoever edits last. This is why Wikipedia is unreliable in many days, and is a lost cause.

 Dance-rock redirection 

I change the dance-rock redirection, from dance music to  [[Post-disco#Dance-Rock]] . From actual-point-of-view , Dance-Rock can not have its own article, because of its sources. Dance-Rock's only source is All Music Guide, so there can be a WP:V problem. Anyway, Google finds """"nothing"""" (only just irrelevant pages), except.. yes AMG and Last.fm. However, some remarking have page of Billboard magazine from 2004.

I also created Dance-Rock redirect.   

AllMusic source
This article is one of a number of music genre articles that were created solely using AllMusic as a source, and for which few other sources seemed to be available. I'd rather have just deleted it, but decided instead to trim and rephrase it so that it was perfectly clear that elevating the term """"post-disco"""" to genre status was apparently an attempt to fill a gap in AllMusic's taxonomy of genres, and that it was the creation of a now-uncredited individual author who was paid to write it. Also I wanted to show the author never really defined it as a musical style; it wasn't ever established how it was related to disco on one end and house music on the other.

Recently the article has been expanded to cite other mentions of """"post-disco"""". I'm fine with that, but I'm not convinced every use of the term was really intended to be interpreted as a genre name. I'm just afraid this article is doing the exact same thing the AllMusic blurb did: trying too hard to give traction to a name for something that really didn't have a name, or that perhaps was only called """"boogie"""". I feel like I'd rather see a section of the Boogie article devoted to the dance music genre than to continue down the road of searching for vague references to dance music in the post-disco era as evidence of an accepted genre name. —  
My opinion is that post-disco is also genre (""""boogie""""), but also a movement, but that's WP:POV. I don't know.. I mean I don't understand what's really """"post-disco"""" (after disco era / boogie genre ?) means at all. If it is """"era"""" so all tracks to present is """"post-disco"""", but if it is a genre... (unsourced; only AMG and some kind of sites like """" danceclassics.net"""" etc).   

 OR & source misrepresentation in lead: analysis 

None of the cited sources other than Allmusic suggest that """"post-disco"""" is a genre. Many of the citations are also WP:SPS.

The term post-disco (or simply boogie) has multiple meanings. Citation does not support the assertion that """"post-disco"""" has multiple meanings or that it is a term interchangeable with Boogie

Sometime after 1990,AMG was founded in 1991 —  an Allmusic editorial contributor used """"post-disco"""" in an attempt to isolate a dance music genre in the era between the indistinct """"end"""" of disco music and the equally indistinct emergence of house music. Proposition unsupported by a third party verifiable source, this is editorial analysis therefore WP:OR

Your appeal

Here's your appeal for retention of the Sabal article, which will soon be deleted. You may wish to recycle it elsewhere.

This article is very relevant to fashion photography section. He is noted as a top emerging """"fashion"""" photographer by one of the most prestigious fashion magazines. You do not shoot for
Vogue Magazine on any level foreign or domestic, if your not accepted across the board by Conde Nast. (The largest """"Fashion"""" publishing house in the world)
He has 8 pages in Vogue Brazil this Month( Jan 09), 8Pages in Sept of 08. (Which is referenced and linked) Plus, Spanish Vogue.
 Come on this is not unbiased judgement which I would expect from Wiki.
 However I trust this process will work. And it will be review unbiasedly. )

About me I am a fashion journalism freshman at NYU and this is my assignment to add a relevant fashion person to Wiki. This seems to be a personal issue if it's blocked.
I see Mr. Sabal's images on covers, editorails and shooting top models on youtube. He is far more accredited than half of the people on the current fashion photography section; if not more than half.

Being published in Vogue Magazine internationally and having shot most of the top supermodels for very notable fashion clients is far more than half the section already accepted by Wiki.
 His charity acts, and his personal life seem to make him a very interesting and notable personality and relevant to the section. 
(However, I am willing to leave out the personal stuff because it doesnt matter somuch even though the references are fashion people.)

Had I not found the Vogue and Surface Magazine references, the videos on youtube shooting a top Victoria's Secrets Angel- I would pass and not spend the time.
I dissagree completly with deleting a Vogue photographer from this section, if anything based on the fashion photography section, all these music video directors and
foreign portrait photographers should be eliminated instead of a full fleged fashion photographer, with notable """"fashion clients, magazines and """"Supermodels"""".

Please let me know how to proceed.

I am not optimistic at all but I do agree that we can find objective mediation. We found it last time with the Cabal. My point is that objective or not, fair or not, truthful or not, this mediation imho will not solve the issue. It is divided for a reason and that's because both sides have facts that support their views. Like a split decision prize fight if you get 50 fair judges you will still have a judgment that is all over the place, maybe even 25-25. I don't recall where but I believe it was said that by """"agreeing"""" we agree to accept this new resolution. I cannot in good conscience sign my name to the agree side based on that condition and the fact I can't see how this will really bring things to an end.

Having worked in radio for 18+ years in the Harrisonburg, Virginia area, and having worked for WACL (98 Rock) for 5 years (ending in 2005), I have respectfully asked that the format information for this station be changed to reflect it's official format, which is Classic Rock. The station's official format is Classic Rock, not Rock, Album Oriented Rock and not Active Rock. I received this response from users who will not allow me to edit the content myself:

    """"I talked with that other user and he said since WACL """"makes no clear distinction in its marketing (and based on the station website and group website, it doesn't) either rely on the Arbitron listing (which is derived from the station's own reporting)"""" it should fall under the Rock label. Not AOR, or Classic Rock, just plain old Rock. I will make a note in the article that the station plays a 50/50 """"blend"""" of Classic Rock and Active Rock. - NeutralHomer • Talk • """"

In my opinion, the accuracy of the content depends on fact, not on how the station markets itself, and not on Wikipedia users' opinions of what the station sounds like. The station does, in fact, rely on Arbitron when creating sales pitches to their advertisers, and Arbitron lists the station as Classic Rock because the station has reported to Arbitron that it's official format is Classic Rock. Having an extensive amount of professional experience in radio in Harrisonburg, Virginia qualifies me as an expert on this particular subject. Again I ask that the following changes be made to the content on the WACL article:

    WACL (98.5 FM, """"98 Rock"""") is a Classic Rock formatted broadcast radio station licensed to Elkton, Virginia, USA, serving the Harrisonburg/Staunton, Virginia, area. WACL is owned and operated by Clear Channel Communications.

    History

    The station first launched on February 22, 1989, with the callsign WPKZ. During that time, the station would carry a country music format, branded as """"Z-98"""".

    On March 7, 1997, the format was changed to classic rock, branded as """"Cool 98.5"""". To accommodate this, the callsign was changed to WACL. On May 2, 2001 at midnight, WACL changed their branding to """"98 Rock"""". On April 1, 2008, WACL began carrying the syndicated radio program Nights with Alice Cooper, when it moved from WBHB-FM at 105.1 FM (now WTGD) to WACL-FM at 98.5 FM when the format had been switched to classic country.

    Music

    WACL plays a blend of Classic Rock and Active Rock.

The current content is completely inaccurate and non-verifiable. Because I am an expert, I am considered a verifiable source according to Wikipedia. Allowing inaccurate information to remain in any article on Wikipedia goes against what Wikipedia is all about - providing true and accurate information that is not based on point of view or users' opinions.

Scott, i think that is evidence that you still just don't get it.  this has nothing to do with string theory.  string theory is non-sequitur.  i hardly understand string theory (really, just the pop stuff Brian Greene puts on Nova), but i fully understand the argument that, in reality, the only physical quantities that we measure, that we perceive, that make any difference to anything that involves us as human beings (or E.T. beings, for that matter) are dimensionless quantities.  when something changes that affects us, ultimately it's a dimensionless measure, usually the ratio of like dimensioned quantities.  we always measure a dimensionful quantity against another like dimensioned quantity.

if  changed (let's say got bigger), conceptually, that would have meaning, the electromagnetic force (relative to the other fundamental interactions) would have changed in proportion (gotten a little bigger).  then it would appear that the charge of an electron has gotten a little bigger (but it might not have) or that Planck's constant has gotten a little smaller (but it might not have) or that the speed of light has gotten a little smaller (that's the choice you and authors such as Moffat made) or even (if we're gonna say that  might have changed) that the permittivity of free space has changed (like ,  is defined in many measurement systems, such as SI or cgs).  (i doubt anyone will argue that it's  or  that has changed.)  heck, someday soon (i would expect within a decade)  will be defined (because of a redefinition of the kilogram).  if they do that, then a change in  gets blamed on a change of , which still seems most natural to me, but that's my opinion.  even so,. if they did that to  and  was measured to have changed, i would not argue that all of the electrons and protons and positrons in the universe have somehow transferred charge.  i would say that they appear to have a different charge since their strength of their interaction has changed (which is fundamentally all a change in  can mean).  that is all we would know or could ever know.  to blame any conceptual change of  on a change of any of the dimensionful ingredients to it, is silly.  16:04, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)"

Here's my two cents, and probably worth every penny, well maybe half. MSF (Microsoft Flight) does in fact contain every bit of a """"real"""" flight sim (except its way more realistic, environmentally), but you don't have to. That's the whole and entire arguement. Many old time players heard that anyone could simply fly with a mouse and they lost their minds. But you can turn that all off, the automatic stuff. It will allow you the complete flight simulator experience of MSFS (Microsoft Flight Simulator and other sims), except not everyone will have to do it like that, and the weather (fog, clouds, light, shadow, etc) will be much more realistic. Take a look at that cockpit view of the Maule, all those buttons, switches, knobs, pedals can be used, all of it. The complete control is there; only some kid or grandma might be using their mouses and have all of that stuff being done for them by the computer.

Should the new Country Party (which is, I should add, extraordinarily unlikely to achieve registration under its current name) receive that kind of coverage, or get some defectors in its ranks, then we might make an exception for it too. In the meantime, this is simply a case of WP:TOOSOON.

This statement is incorrect. The Executive Order that Bayh passed did not require employees to join the union, nor were they ever required to join. Also, the order was passed in 1990 so it is pretty much factually incorrect.

 Section on Austria

You say that dogs were eaten in Saxony, which is not in Austria but in Germany. The source material you cite, it confusingly talks about things happening in both countries, so it was an easy mistake to make.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

I rechecked the source, and see that the Saxony section is definitely separate from the Austria section. I decided to just change the section title from """"Austria"""" to """"Saxony"""", since that is more accurately what the article says (and doesn't get into the complexity of how old kingdoms map onto present day ones).  However, if others think Germany is better, that's fine by me.   """

0,"Careful here, the stochiometric ratio is independent of air pressure. A locomotive at high altitude would operate at the same steam gauge pressure, and hence produce the same power as at low altitude. I agree that the fire will produce less heat at higher altitude. However, only if the fire was unable to produce enough energy would the power of the steam engine be significantly reduced, but I expect that most fires in steam engines have ample reserve capacity to produce sufficient heat. 
By way of contrast, a 20% reduction in air pressure presumably would give about a 20% reduction in power in an internal combustion engine, unless super or turbocharged."

0,"Wikipedia is, in fact, the closest thing to a people's encyclopedia that currently exists, in terms of its popularity. More people read Wikipedia than any other encyclopedia. That doesn't mean Wikipedia relies on a democratic definition of truth. If we did, we would have to state, as a fact, that God exists, because a majority of the world's English-speaking people believe that claim to be true. Fortunately for God, he's still got some gaps to hide in, so for the time being the existence of God is not a scientific question. But anthropogenic global warming certainly is, and this is probably one of the aspects of scientific consensus that stands in greatest contradiction to popular belief. The vast majority of ordinary people display no detectable concern about continuing to burn fossil fuels, and a sizable fraction either deny that burning fossil fuels can possibly influence the climate, or doubt that the influence would be harmful. Wikipedia can certainly report on who believes what. We have a List of scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming."

I'm not alone believing this was not a case of outing, and making unproven allegations of misconduct, in this case outing, is also a form of personal attack designed to undermine the other editor, and Offliner has been warned in the past not to file such vexatious claims. Offliner is a veteran of filing complaints on WP:AE, and if this comes under WP:DIGWUREN (and Kuril Islands dispute seems to fall outside of the scope of that case being Eastern Europe), he should know that board would have been the more appropriate place to lodge that complaint, but perhaps he wouldn't have achieved the same result.

In 2007, A. Carlito was doing production work for local artists with his keyboards. A few months later, he was introduced by a friend who was also an producer. Around the same time, he met four friends. Vinnie, Base, Chino and Pat who were local emcees and a singer in the Connecticut area and joined to become the group known as Tru Saga. He then began DJ'ing for them at shows and produced a number of their beats on underground records.

As an up-and-coming producer, he released a album of Carlito's Way 2007. This album began what is now a regular trend. A. Carlito has a smooth and soulful production style that relies on samples from artists such as Dee Edwards and Curtis Mayfield. He attributes the bass lines that he uses in production to DJ Premier, Pete Rock and HeatMaker. The producer continued to produce for Tru Saga and many other Hiphop artists/groups, including KRS-1 and many more.

A. Carlito still resides in Connecticut. He has announced his new label, Mi Gente and is still with Tru Saga Records. He soon will release his second solo album entitled Carlito's Way Vol. 2."

I did not delete content nor did I blank anything, I deleted a comment that I made while using someone else s account. That was an accident.

You responded by threatening with a ban for deleting what was mine to delete.

To expand on one aspect of that: Wikipedia's three main content policies are:
WP:Neutral point of view, which Peridon mentioned,
WP:Verifiability: """"all quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be attributed to a reliable, published source... The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth—whether readers can check that material in Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, not whether editors think it is true.""""
WP:No original research: """"The term """"original research"""" (OR) is used on Wikipedia to refer to material—such as facts, allegations, and ideas—for which no reliable, published source exists.""""

 Armenian Genocide 
Peres' denial of the genocide should be noted in this article, failing to do so makes it more of a hagiography than a biography. His shortcomings must also be mentioned in addition to his feats like winning the noble prize. Do you think it'd fit better in political views? In anycase it must, and will, be mentioned somewhere. How about adding this in his political views segment: 

Peres' foreign policy outlook is markedly realist. For example, to placate Turkey, the only significant Muslim country in the region that is friendly towards Israel, Peres has explicity denied the Armenian genocide, which caused an uproar among genocide scholars.(citation)   

Peres made these statements in 2001, when he was foreign minister. Clearly, he was caving in to Turkish pressure. Israel has very few friends and cannot afford to lose them, so basically it is not free to take the position that would seem to mesh with its outlook and history, which is to recognize that the Armenians were murdered en mass. Now he is president, an honorary position, not a political one, and his """"views,"""" whatever they may have been back then, are worth about as much as mine are. I have no problem with mentioning this """"view"""" in the section on his political outlook, but a separate section on this one utterance gives it undue importance and distorts the picture.

It seems to me, to use a Christian metaphor, that you cast the first stone.  Basically my attitude here is that it is not only good men who should be identified as Christians.  If someone self-identifies as a train enthusiast that is good enough for me.  If there is a Wikipedia category for train enthusiasts then he should be included.  The category is for """"train enthusiasts"""" not """"good train enthusiasts"""".  We have no need to examine the purity of his enthusiasm.   

Besides, you are on a slippery slope.  In one Western democracy yesterday it was announced that more than 180,000 abortions happened last year.  That country is run by one who identifies himself very publicly as a Christian.  But he never speaks out against abortion.  He also took his country to war on false pretenses (he deliberately told lies) and in that war 20,000 innocent civilians have died who would not have died if there had been no war.  Using your argument Tony Blair cannot be identified as a Christian.   

But I do not want to use your argument.  Nor do I think we should.  (But even if we use your argument we cannot see into Tariq Aziz's soul.)  That you (presumably another Christian) re-act with distaste that Aziz belongs to the same club is not the point.

Yes, knowing something to be untrue, is generally accepted as a reason to tag or remove material. In fact, the extreme argument, which I do not have much sympathy with, is that questioning un-sourced material is always acceptable, no matter what the intention. (But then people generally add some proviso when arguing this extreme version, such as """"except when we are talking about obvious behavior issues"""".)
Trying to formulate what less extreme people think, I would say that believing something to be unlikely to be something that people could come to a consensus about being true is a valid reason for tagging or removing material.
This is perfectly consistent with our real way of working: verifiability, the ability to confirm that something is what rational people could agree to be true, is our threshold for inclusion, but not personal opinions about what is true.

0,"""With over 100,000 college students studying abroad every year, there's bound to be all kinds of tall tales, urban legends, and misinformation swirling around.  While there may be grains of truth in some of these stories, below are some common misconceptions about study abroad.

Misconception #1: Studying abroad is very expensive.

Truth: In most cases, it is actually cheaper to study abroad.  Let's say the tuition at your school is $5,000 per semester and room and board is another $4,000.  Now add in the additional fees you have such as health insurance, books, and laundry.  You are now well over $10,000 for the semester.  Well, all but one of our programs in Spain is under $10,000 per semester and that includes everything except your airfare and spending money.
TAB

Misconception #2: I can't use my financial aid to study abroad.

Truth: In almost all cases, your federal aid (Stafford loans, Pell grants, etc.) can be used to study abroad and in some states, you can use your state aid as well.  It is also not uncommon for your federal aid to increase when you study abroad since some of your school scholarships may not transfer.

Misconception #3: Host families are all poor and just do it for the money.

Truth: The last thing any study abroad company wants to do is have an unhappy student on their program.  The goal is for the students to be happy so that they will tell their friends what a great time they had.  If we were putting students in bad families, in dangerous neighborhoods, then no one would ever recommend us to their friends.  Since the number of universities that endorse our program doubled over the last year, it's a pretty sure bet that students are happy with our choice of families. 

Misconception #4: I'll be so busy with schoolwork that I won't get time to see the country I'm in.

Truth: This one is hysterically funny since your average study abroad student comes home with about 400+ photos from a long list of countries.  Students have plenty of opportunities to travel and we even take our students on trips to give them a better feel for the country they are in.

Misconception #5: I might not graduate on time if I go abroad.

Truth: If you have already used up all of your elective or general education courses, then it's true that you might need to bulk up on courses before or after you go abroad.  If you plan ahead, however, and leave some electives open to you, then you should be fine.  The clear majority of students who study abroad still graduate in four years, despite being away from their home campus for a semester or two.

Misconception #6: Most of the world hates Americans, so I won't be safe.

Truth: There's no doubt that there are a lot of people who don't like the American government, but that has nothing to do with the American people.  If you compare the violent crime rate in the United States to that of European, Australian, or Asian countries, you will see that the United States is actually far more dangerous.  There are some areas of South America and Africa that are not especially safe, but there are also many countries on those continents that are incredibly safe.  Go to the U.S. State Department website and check out the crime statistics on the country you are interested in to see how safe it is.

Studying abroad is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that every college student should take advantage of.  Before dismissing it due to the bad experience of one friend or rumors you have had heard, speak with your study abroad advisor and get the facts.  I guarantee that once you look at all that studying abroad can offer you, you'll be hopping the first flight abroad.

One organization that help ensure that you have safest, unforgettable yet affordable study abroad experience is Academic Studies Abroad.    Here are some of our very popular study abroad programsin the following countries:

-Study Abroad Spain- Academic Studies offers study abroad programs in Barcelona, Madrid, Salamanca and Sevilla.  

-Study Abroad England- Academic Studies offers study abroad programs in London.  

-Study Abroad Italy - Academic Studies offers study abroad programs in Florence.  

-Study Abroad France- Academic Studies offer study abroad programs in Aix-en-Provence and Avignon.

Like any great leader Catherine realized in order to become a major player in the European trade industry she must spread her empire far beyond its limits. Although she knew the implications if she were to fail she advanced on. She defeated the Ottoman Empire, which was said to be the Turks greatest loss. She expanded her country more than 200,000 miles, giving her empire more ties to European art and culture.
Catherine often referred to herself as the “despot of enlightenment”, this was due to her on going pursue of knowledge for herself and for her country. She did this by writing a series of educational manuals for the Russian youth. Although this was an important accomplishment in itself her greatest educational contribution to Russia was the Smolny Institute for young noble women, which became the most profound school of its time.
Catherine was a patron of the arts and obtained an enormous collection, which is known as the Hermitage collection occupied the entire Winter Palace (Residence of the Russian tsars). Her influence became so wide spread that many various French writers wrote about her. Including Voltaire, calling her the “Star of the North” and “The Semiramis Russia."

A tag has been placed on Greg Earnest, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

I'll confess to being a bit lost among these theological discussions. I can say that we should include all significant points of view, even Geaves'. If some say that Rawat had a Sant Mat lineage, while other say he had an Advait Mat or Radhasoami lineage, then all of those views should be included, in proportion to their prominence, and we shouldn't take sides either directly or by implication. Note that each of those linked topics has an article of its own, so we don't need to discuss them at length in this article. Anything we do say about them should be relevant to Rawat himself. 
More broadly, I'd remind everyone that we have an entire article devoted to Rawat's teachings, Teachings of Prem Rawat. The material in this article should simply be a summary of that article. Since the introductory section of that article should also summarize that article, in an ideal world we could simply copy to the intro here as a summary. Unfortunately, this is not an ideal world. That article has needed work for years, but there hasn't been any significant editing there in the past year. May I suggest moving this discussion to that talk page?     talk   """

Certainly not. The alphabet has been copied """"as is"""" from Swedish, and it has been so since Mikael Agricola began writing Finnish. Fortunately the Swedish alphabet contains enough sounds like Ä and Ö that Finnish speakers didn't have to design any new letters. Then again, unused letters like Q and Å remain. The last changes to Finnish orthography with respect to the alphabet were the changes from 'C' to 'K', 'X' to 'KS', 'TZ' to 'TS' and 'W' to 'V', in the 18th and 19th century. 'C', 'X', 'Z' and 'W' remained in the alphabet but were no longer used.

Found it (capacity to conduct foreign relations). But it's not the """"problem"""" criteria for SoP - for SoP the problem criteria is the control of populated territory (e.g. ability of the SoP government to enforce SoP laws there). For example on p10/11 of the source: """"has a government...have a legislative body...have a judicary...have an executive, which carries out the laws and has at its disposal a considerable force responsive to its will."""" - in the case of SoP the territory it claims (regardless of undefined borders) is under Israel occupation/control. All other criteria are more or less satisfied - PLO-EC is SoP provisional government in exile, SoP has established diplomatic relations with many other states, SoP has diplomatic recognition by many other states, SoP accepts the membership obligations and has submitted membership application. The rest of the criteria depend on the judgment of UNSC and UNGA - whether SoP is """"peace loving"""", whether SoP is """"able and willing"""" to carry out the membership obligations. Even if it's deemed """"peace loving and willing to carry out the obligations"""" the """"problem"""" criteria is whether it's """"really a state"""" (because it doesn't have control over populated territory) and the related whether it's """"able to carry out the obligations"""" (because a state needs control over populated territory, otherwise it functions only in the diplomatic realm as a government-in-exile and doesn't have the ability to do anything on the ground). Of course, if the majority of all UNSC permanent members and 2/3rds of the UN members want - for political reasons - they can grant membership to a GiE (turn a blind eye to the lack of territorial control or resort to some reasoning that it's able to comply and only the foreign occupation prevents it, but that occupation is declared illegal by this and that UNSC and ICJ acts, so they won't take it into account, etc.)

there is no hardly and open source or wikipedia work being done here and we would like to promote that.

Your nomination for AfD was appropriate, and it sure looked like a consensus to delete to me; it should be re-AfD'ed at some point. BTW, I once wrote a paper on a rather technical aspect of Georg Forster's scientific work, and was quite surprised to find out that he was a major figure in the Aufklarung. 
I agree it should have been deleted, but is not worth fighting over right now (in two months the author will probably have gone away and it can be deleted). About Georg Forster: It would be great if you could check what the article says about his scientific work.  and I were mostly busy translating the German article and enhancing the Mainz Republic stuff and trying to NPOVify the anti-Polonism section, which are pretty well-sourced by now, but can't say all that much about his reputation in science other than what the German article said. I would appreciate it if you could comment on that a bit, or even enhance the article. Happy editing,  (討論)"

Afghans... British people.... Persians... or someone else...? Answer Afghanistan; Afghanistan would never do things like this. Even if they wanted, they are simply not able to do things like this and have also no reasons. British people; well British people want to destroy his image and have also the possibilities and the habit to do jobs like this. as a British people knower. Read this . Persians; Persians want to claim Jamaludin Afghan as a Persian personality and are able to do jobs like this. Let it be clear, his real biographies are destroyed and sometime later comes Persia with letters, with Jamaludin Afghan would have writed and after a time, comes his biographies of being from a Persian origins. Well is it not a little bite strange.... don't do you think so...? Except from this, the Persian people have allways try to claim Afghan history and the personalities of Afghans as their own. To claim Jamaludin Afghan as a Persian, they needed to have proves, to have proves, they needed to destroy the real proves (like his Biographies) and to prove what they are saying is right, they needed to create prove. So what is the true behind this letters..? IN PERSIANCA ENCLOPENDIA, they write (Government of India and Maǰmūʿa sources show that in Afghanistan he called himself the Sayyed “Rūmī” (Anatolian) or “Estanbolī” and claimed to be from Istanbul. The government of India reporter noted that he was a stranger to Afghanistan and spoke Persian like an Iranian.) well he have never claimed himself as a Estanboli or if being from Istanbul. this is what i call the propaganda of Persians! if he is not our, we will also don't late make it yours. well in letters and article wite where writed about him in Afghanistan (when he was in Afghanistan), they write only Sayed Jamalludin Afghan, nothing else.

If you really beleive all that Shia crap, then good luck to you, cuz you're gonna need it in life.  You don't seem to have a solid grip on reality.  You seem to live in your own world. Anyhow, I will give you a bit of clue free of charge.  The reason there are some favourable Hadiths for Iranians is, surprise surprise, because out of the 6 main Hadith authors, 4 were Iranians, including the 3 most authoritative ones:  Bukhari, Termezi and Hajjaj.  Nasai was also Iranian.  The first 3 were Khurasani, and Nasai was from Pars.  The other 2 Hadith authors are not as major and their works are basically a copy-and-paste from the Hadith of the Iranian authors.  Hajjaj was from Neyshapour but claimed to be of Qushayri origin, so that he was better accepted as some """"real Arab"""" from an authentic Arabic origin, but there is academic information that he was indeed of Khorasani origin, and his claim of """"al-Qushayri"""" roots is unverifiable.  The most authoritative of the Hadiths is al-Bukhari (from the city of Bukhara).  Having read what you wrote for me, I have reason to believe that someone like you is out of touch with reality and I am not even going to accept an edit war with someone like you. So I let you be happy by deleting the """"forced"""" out of the article, and stay happy with your romanticism and keep thinking that Shahrbanoo indeed chose Husayn and they """"lived happily ever after!"""", and both Ali and Muhammad knew Persian, and """"Shahrbanoo realized that they had special knowledge""""!! hehe no wonder your nation is the way it is today, their """"educated"""" people are like you, I can imagine what the uneducated ones are like!!  -)   22:15, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)"""

Kingdom:     Animalia
Subkingdom:  Eumetazoa
Unranked:    Protostomia
Superphylum: Ecdysozoa
Unranked:    Panarthropoda
Phylum:      Arthropoda
Unranked:    Tetraconata
Subphylum:   Hexapoda
Class: Insecta
If no one objects, I will probably update the classification in this article soon.

Hello. I have removed the text you added here. As you can see, it broke the page. I was unable to fix your references for you, as they are incomplete. When you cite sources, you need to provide more than just the book title and an author's name. If nothing else, you also need the page number, particularly when you are quoting (as you appeared to be doing in several places). You might be interested in looking at , specifically, and more generally Wikipedia:Citing sources. When adding material to article, please also read the text they already contain and work your material in such as to create a comprehensive whole.

I see from the above that there may be some concerns about the nature of the content that you are trying to add to the article as well. Please consider discussing these concerns with other editors at the talk page of the article, Talk:Haida. Wikipedia's articles are developed according to consensus of its contributors, and such conversation is a valuable part of reaching that consensus. Occasionally, where editors disagree, additional dispute resolution may be necessary.  (talk)"

Starcheers doesn't say anything about banning stylization. He/she says that the inclusion of the """"#"""" isn't required. Allow me to explain why the inclusion of # is different to the inclusion of a letter. # stands for one of two things, its a symbolic representation of the word """"number"""" or it is a social media mechanism """"hash-tagging"""" most prominently used on twitter. If the name of the song was read and sung as """"hashtag that power"""" but was written as """"#thatPower"""" then including the """"#"""" is detrimental to the name. However, the name of the song as per what's song and said outloud is """"that power"""". Therefore the inclusion of the """"#"""" is for the social media mechanism rather than to represent the word """"number"""". As a result, the reason to include the """"#"""" is stylistic, i.e. its a stylistic choice for the copyright (the copyright being legally registering the song is a recorded work), but it is not pronounced in the work nor is it part of the title. the inclusion of """"i"""" in """"iphone"""" is not stylistic, it is part of the copyright and part of the name, thus including the i is detrimental to the work in question as a phone and an iphone are two different things whereas #thatpower and thatpower are one in the same, as in this context the """"#"""" has no meaning. —  [talk] 19:50, 21"""

As I explained in an edit summary this sentence attempts to summarise the information in mephedrone#UK. 'People have died after taking mephedrone' is intended to summarise """"mephedrone had been alleged to be involved in 52 fatalities in the UK, but detected in only 38 of these cases"""". Likewise 'some deaths the media attributed to the drug were later determined to have been caused by other factors' is summarising """"The death of a teenager in the UK in November 2009 was widely reported as being caused by mephedrone, but a report by the coroner concluded she had died from natural causes. In March 2010, the deaths of two teenagers in Scunthorpe were widely reported by the media to be caused by mephedrone. Toxicology reports showed the teenagers had not taken any mephedrone and had died as a result of consuming alcohol and the heroin substitute methadone"""". Both parts are important and should be mentioned in the lead and if you read the references you should realise that this is exceptional to mephedrone as deaths were over-reported and mis-reported by the media - comparisons with other topics are irrelevant. I agree that it is a bit weasely, but how else to you suggest that that section is summarised? WP:LEADCITE is very vague about whether citations are required and when I wrote the lead I erred on making it easier to read rather than ensuring that every fact was supported by a citation there (Wikipedia:Citation_overkill). I could easily copy the references from the main article to the lead for this sentence, but then someone will likely come along and complain that other sentences don't have citations... IMO this is a waste of time when readers could just find the relevant citations in the main body of the article.   """

This statement is not at all supported by the citation. The citation only mentions statistics about people who were """"Scouts"""" not specifically those who reached the rank of Eagle Scout. Since """"Scouts"""" are undefined in the source we are left to assume they are claiming that anyone who spent a single day in the """"Scouts"""" is to be considered a """"Scout"""" and thus they statistics are biased. However, this is incidental. The main issue is that the stats don't relate to Eagle Scouts at all.
So, the citation is a prejudiced source and it does not cite a neutral source for the statistics it claims. The two sentences about disproportional representation in """"major professions"""" (whatever those are) are unsupported and the tone does not seem at all neutral. Since it is not supported by the citation or any real world statistics, I suggest it be removed completely unless a neutral source can back it up.

 read the truth at http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

Regarding the writer at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hitler_salute

    Mr Barlow is a nutter with an obsession. The history of the salute is now improved in the Roman salute article (which had many previous visits from Dr. Curry in the past - see its talk page). The pact between the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is not well known, and is also not covered widely on Wikipedia, so it is """"covered up"""" by people and also people often refer to it as the """"Nazi-Soviet"""" pact (as the writer above does) which avoids ever using the actual name of the horrid Party (the National Socialist German Workers' Party) and reinforces the hackneyed use of the shorthand """"Nazi"""" and the myth that members of the National Socialist German Workers' Party referred to themselves as """"Nazis"""" (they did not refer to themselves as """"Nazis"""").  Some people (note the writer above) try to evade the point with odd comments such as """"It wasn't invented by Wikipedia editors to conceal the word 'socialism'!""""  That comment does not dispute the fact that there are people who use the word """"Nazi"""" to avoid ever stating the actual name of the party: The National Socialist German Workers' Party. Not only is that done in the title of the page cited (the Nazi-Soviet pact page) it is done on that entire article where the actual name of the Party never appears nor even the phrase """"National Socialist."""" The writer above also makes constant use of the shorthand """"Nazi"""" even when discussing the very topic at hand.  The Bellamy salute was not originally the same as the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, as noted by Professor Curry. However, as anyone who looks at Dr. Curry's historic photographs of the salute can see, it developed into the same salute as that of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Even the writer above concedes Dr. Curry's point that the flag was saluted with a normal military-style salute and then the arm was straightened out toward the flag during the oath. The writer above tellingly evades the point that the use of the military salute led to the change in the salute to the U.S. flag.  It is as if the writer above is conceding the point made. Indeed, the writer seems to concede it with the comment """"Anyway, even if the gesture had been the same, so what? It's just a gesture. The Soviets used conventional salutes, does that mean that the US military are Communists because they use the same gesture as the Soviet military!""""   It is fascinating how the writer again avoids the actual name """"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics"""" and also used the term """"Communist"""" instead of using the term """"Socialist.""""  The writer then attempts to avoid the issue, which is the origin of the straight-arm salute, and tries to turn the issue into an odd argument about whether the salutes dictated particular dogmas.  Nevertheless, the writer evades the topic that Professor Curry has raised, which is that Francis Bellamy and Edward Bellamy were  self-proclaimed National Socialists in the USA three decades before the National Socialist German Workers' Party, and Edward's book was an international bestseller, translated into every major language (including German, which Edward spoke and wrote, and where Edward had studied as a young man) and that Edward's dogma inspired """"Nationalism"""" clubs worldwide including in Germany. 

    Yes, the """"Roman salute"""" page did once contain innaccuracies, and the writer above is to be thanked for conceding that point. But that is no reason for the writer to start going on with his use of the term """"conspiracy."""" It's just what you get when you have an open encyclopedia! The point is to correct error when you see it, and to not delete those corrections when they are made by people like Dr. Curry.  

    The writer above also concedes that he is the Wikipedia editor who """"became wiser"""", by incorporating Professor Curry's discoveries.  The writer is to be thanked for crediting Dr. Curry with making it more widely available. It should be noted that the valuable information that Professor Curry provides is his own discovery.  Dr. Curry has also mentioned that the material about the use of the Roman salute in films derives from an academic article by Martin Winkler. Professor Curry pointed out that Martin Winkler did not realize at the time of Winkler's article that the films were all pre-dated by the use of the salute in the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance.  Dr. Curry has also publicly challenged Martin Winkler to debate these issues.  Professor Curry's discovery that the swastika/hakenkreuz, although an ancient symbol, was sometimes used by the National Socialist German Workers' Party as """"S"""" shapes standing for its """"Socialism"""" is also his own original work. And he is right that other writers have deliberate"

0,"Answer: You use the date July 20 of 1599 AD as Thot 1 and retreat one date back every 4 years, or 30 days back in 120 years. Example, 240 years is 60 days back to May 21 of 1839 AD, or Apr 21 of 1959 AD, then add 13 days in our 1900 or 2000 century to have Gregorian May 4 in 1959 AD. Another 44 years to 2003 AD and 11 leap days takes all the dates back to April 23. Then 2004-2007 is April 22. In reply to the post below which says the Coptic calendar is not Egyptian, the answer is our September 11 as Thot 1 is Julian August 29. Though the Coptic calendar (Egyptian with leap days) was accepted in 284 AD (which Era of Diocletion is the Era of Christian Martyrs so coincidentally the year 6000 of Adam in the Jewish book of Josephus published in Rome), this calendar leap day was created in 27 BC by Augustus Octavius Caesar who inaugurated it in 25 BC when Thoht 1 becomes August 29. Therefore, the Coptic calendar is Julian (not Gregorian). Events against America have been on Egyptian dates. The August 2 invasion of Kuwait is Julian July 20 and the invasion takes place at 30 degrees where the rise of Sothis occurs on that date only at that latitude; this implying Saddam chose the rise to invade. However, they felt world trade controlling oil was USA blame. Another date is Thoth 1 was Feb 26 in 747 BC. In 1993 the world trade was bombed on Gregorian Feb 26 not taking into account that Julian Feb 26 is March 11 (March 10 in leap year). The Coptic calendar honors this date as the half year placing Pamenot 1 on March 10 and the internet terrorists attempt to destroy world trade by constantly revising the March 10 virus."

Biography

Offenbach's father, Isaac Juda Eberst, born 26 October 1779 in Offenbach am Main, took the name Offenbach in 1808 when he was already in Deutz where he had moved in 1802.Yon, Jean-Claude. Jacques Offenbach. Editions Gallimard, Paris, 2000.

The alternative would appear to be a long explanation of the Napoleonic edict.

  
Thank you, that sounds good, although I would prefer a link to an explanatory article or some footnote, but maybe that's just me. One more thing: the italics around his father's name and the bolding of Offenbach ought to be dropped.    

 Play titles 
Confusingly, in 'other stage works', three of the play titles with a Wikipedia link are no longer spelled the same (case) as given in the articles about the plays...   
Can you clarify? There are no red links in that section. zach 
There aren't any red links because the three plays in question are piped links to their English titles. Cg2p0B0u8m's observation that the French titles in these articles uses different capitalisation is correct. We know that the most widely used style of French title capitalisation, which is a bit idosyncratic and not cosnsistently applied in French writing, is not used in the opera or classical music projects on Wikipedia where a strict but easily understood system is used. Other projects are not so strict; that's why those articles on the plays use a different spelling.    
Ah. Missed that. Shouldn't we be using the English titles? After all The Tales of Hoffmann appears just below. zach 
Wouldn't that make for an awkward list as we don't have English titles for all these plays?    
Perhaps, but then what is the least bad solution? My primary editing instinct tells me that consistency should come first — at least within the article. zach 
But at the cost of consistency within the paragraph. — (shrug) Whatever, no biggie. The list itself is a useful improvement to the article, in whichever language the titles are listed.    

Yes, it's not a major thing. From Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(France_%26_French-related)#Works_of_art it seemed that only classical music and opera had opted out of l’Académie française / into 'Grove'; no problem.    
Also visual arts, but as we have often remarked, this is a classic 'no-win' situation. zach """

Faith?
Faith can mean 'complete confidence in a person or plan, etc.' Faith can also mean 'Belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence'. When a theist speaks of his faith, it is argued, he refers to the latter definitions. When he wishes to assert that """"atheists have faith, too"""", the only definition that fits is the first[citation needed], but his argument implies the latter definitions, nonetheless (see equivocation).

Quite often theists have used the argument that life occurring from no life is highly improbable to the point of near impossibility. This is also the case with many of the """"proofs"""" of God such as those by Thomas Aquinas, which would also be more in line with the latter than the former.  Now while they may be wrong in their assumptions to come to the conclusion of the probability of life or the existence of God, what they are speaking about would be more in line with the latter definition that the former in their argument.  The validity of what they are saying does not impact what they """"wish to assert"""", so they may indeed be asserting both points at the same time. Perhaps a qualifier such as under a purely theological perspective would improve this paragraph.  Or change to """"the definition that usually fits within context(the only definition that fits) is the first"""".

0,"The reasons I dont contribute to Wikipedia anymore 
Reversions like the one you just executed on the psychology template presuppose a knowledge of psychology. I must imagine that if you don't understand why the template is inadequate then you have not the faintest idea of what constitutes pscyhology. It is a) an academic (taught) discipline, b) a research discipline, c) an applied discipline, d) a profession, interest group and lobby e) a property of of social perception or a folk psychology if you like and f) an aspect of the humanities and the social sciences as well as a peer of psychiatry, social work and in some respects occupational therapy; g) a contested political terrain (which you would understand if a non-amateur had written the articles on critical psychology and cultural-historical psychology). Neither the template nor the main article bring out these distinctions. Instead what you have is a bad summary of a first year textbook of an American perspective on the psychodynamic-post- Skinnerian model of psychology circa 1950s. Having to explain this and to persuade you is hardly what someone with advanced expertise in the area wants to be doing on a Saturday afternoon. It is insulting, demoralizing and a waste of time. I imagine that the net sum of your expertise can probably be located at the lower end of a) or e) in which case you are probably enthuisiastic about your ignorance. So thank you for giving me one more reason not to contribute to 

A PhD from Yale. What absolute horseshit. I have one from Harvard and another from Cambridge and if you have from Yale I'd be curious where you bought it.

Please do I notice you have had lots of these skirmishes.

0,"Hi - couldn't find the battle on 'scots romans' until I googled 'caledonians 9th legion', which gave good background. I didn't realise that the losses were so bad that the entire legion had to be reformed from scratch, and that the *replacement* 9th Legion appeared to have been wiped out some time later. 
Also, re Lang Vei, I was looking for accounts that tell the story from the Vietnamese point of view - there's lots of stuff on various heroics by Americans, but nothing about how the battle was planned and executed by the Vietnamese. This would tie in nicely with your Night Combat, because clearly it was an attack designed to use the night as a tactical advantage. And the use of tanks was a fairly radical departure in that context. I'm guessing the US forces must have been aware that tanks were in the area, because there were around 100 LAWs rockets issued to the base, but the preparedness for armoured attack is also not really covered in the article except to say they 'weren't ready' for such an attack. This doesn't make much sense - if they were issued with a huge ile of anti-tank weapons then they *must* have expected such attacks? Again, it would be useful to hear from the Vietnamese on their opponents preparedness or otherwise. Normally of course, the history is written by the victors - but not in this instance! That's probably because all the US vets speak English and use the internet, while the Vietnamese have a language barrier and no AOL....."

The main reason I was editing this page is because contributions by user """"Laveol"""" are offensive to the Macedonians. Lazar Kolisevski was a Macedonian, from Republic of Macedonia.
But still he does not deserver to have false information published under his English Wikipedia Page. I have to add that Macedonian Wikipedia Page about Lazar Kolisevski is what the English Page should be edited.
In general there are a lot of negation politics from the Macedonia's neighboring countries. Any of them would negate something about Macedonia: country, nation, language, culture, history, name and so on.
The information from Laveol is in line with this negation policies of those countries, in this case from Bulgaria. Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda is mainly based on negating the Macedonians as a separate nation, Macedonian as a separate language, same about the history.

Given the (non)popularity of Lazar Kolisevski in the modern times Laveol was able to edit the page and have that false information be viewable to Wikipedia users.
This was over that top and I decided to take action about it - Delete the false information, which is not only false, but is offensive to Macedonians and Macedonian People.

When you are Macedonian, your parents are Macedonian. Not Bulgarian or any other nationality.
When you talk about this sensitive topics, you cannot use books published in Bulgaria, as most of them are Propagandistic, working on the principles on 19th century Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda and Expansionism.

So the reason why that information by Laveol is deleted by me is that it is false and offensive to Macedonians.

So how is this not a reliable source for the statement of what PLR practitioners claim PLR has done? This should be regardless of your opinion whether the claim is correct. There are also counter claims about the efficacy of PLR which should be included in the article, for example: M Schröter-Kunhardt (1996).

0,""" are deciding which is a relevant cello sonata and what is not. You have decided that the Carter is relevant and the Blackwood sonata is also relevant (I would be surprised if most cellist would even know Blackwood - I happen to like the work) and they belongs in YOUR version of this list. 

This article as well as other similar ones need to be a list arranged by epoch, or other criteria, otherwise it is not accurately titled.(CELLO SONATA - LIST OF CELLO SONATAS) This information needs to be aquired from all source available. Then organized accordingly. Otherwise you are hindering the true potential of Wikipedia. I am sure of this! Specially in the awakening of internet 2 technologies. 

I cannot but agree with the personal promotion issue. But in this case you are making a particular composer the issue. I have many other composers I'd like to ad to this lists and possibly write about - and I would not mind being edited or corrected by the Wikipedia community, but not by ONE person. This cannot possibly be what Wikipedia intended. If it is so, the visionary model would be compromised and lost in long term. 

If information arrives, which is factual, accurate and sourced. Regardless of source. Should it be included? or is it subject to Editorial opinion based control by ONE person. Please answer me this one question.

And, is the Cello Sonata List a list of existing cello sonatas or only of certain Cello Sonatas which an administrator agrees with as relevant? 

All the best wishes,

 DeStella

All righty then.  If you think I'm biased, go ask for another opinion from another administrator.  There's 1200 of us.  Do it.  The list is here:  Wikipedia:List of Administrators.  I'm sure you can find one who is not """"defensive"""" or does not """"have issues with successful composers"""".  Please leave a post on the administrators' noticeboard if you think I am biased.  Do it!  If you truly believe that I am biased, go get another opinion!  And don't accuse me of having """"my version"""" of the cello sonata article, for I have not edited it except to remove your promotion.  I did not write the article.  (talk) 

Dear Antandrus,

You still did not answer my questions )  Which do not relate to the self promotion issue, which of course is clear. I will in the future refrain from adding any information about family members. But, If information arrives, which is factual, accurate and sourced. Regardless of editor. Should it be included? Isn't it a loss to WP? - And, is the Cello Sonata List (and this question applies to all open lists in WP) a list of all existing cello sonatas or only of certain Cello Sonatas to be determined by  administrators? 
In any case, thank you for your time in clarifying a lot about WP and its mechanisms. 

These are relevant quotes from information I have found in WP guideline pages:

""""Lists should always include unambiguous statements of membership criteria based on definitions made by reputable sources. """"

In this scase the list title is LIST OF CELLO SONATAS. So adding any existing and published cello sonatas should be valid unless the listing title is changed to narrow the list. I would suggest adding the criteria to Cello Sonatas that are in print or published. Do you agree?

And, I simply politely ask that if you have a problem with an entry, you tag the sentence or listing by adding the  or use another WP guideline way to allow for the editor to respond. Not simply arbitrarily remove. In particular with lists.

Thank you again for your time and I look forward to becoming more involved in the WP community. Kudos to all involved!

Hi again; thanks for promising to follow our COI guideline:  that's my main issue, as an administrator, with your edit that started this thread.  As an editor I have no problem with you adding or removing names from lists, and I encourage you to improve articles in any way you would like.  Regarding the list of cello sonatasthis is a problematic issue, and has to do with the evolution of Wikipedia.  Within the last couple years most of the embedded lists within articles have been moved to their own articles, but several years ago that was not the case (see the history of Renaissance music and List of Renaissance composers for an example).  Cello sonata is a sadly neglected article and needs a lot of improvement.  Have a look at List of compositions for cello and piano and List of solo cello pieces for two more places some of these things are written up; and I suggest it may be time to split off"

...which is the reason why I first discuss it, then change it.  An edit war is nothing pretty, you  know?  We'll see.  Anyway, what you write is largely true, but misleading. Especially:

- Free oxygen, free fluorine and moisture surely will corrode the metallic walls.  However, the chemical potential of the salt has to be controlled anyway so it is slightly on the reducing side, containing some trivalent uranium.  So any free oxygen or fluorine will oxydize the uranium ions, not the metal structure.  Moisture will be driven out with the off-gas at working temperatures.  All this is pretty much a non-issue.

- Cryolithe.  Yes, aluminium is produced by electrolysing alumina with cryolithe.  This can be considered a mixture or solution of sodium flouride, aluminium fluoride and aluminum oxide, certainly a molten salt.  But the cryolithe is really only a fluxing agent, it is chemically non-agressive and it doesn't extract aluminium or something.  You hinted that it does, which  is really misleading.

- Heating is not a technological issue.  Sure, it adds to the cost, but other than that there's no problem.  A power reactor would run quite some time without ever being cooled down, refuelling is done by adding some molten or even solid salt, without shutdown, cooling or heating.  

- But tritium is a problem.  To slow down tritium formation, the lithium in the salt has to be almost pure Li-7, and even then tritium will form.  Tritium in the salt is no problem, it doesn't attack metals.  Tritium migrating from the salt is a problem.  ORNL says, they were able to chemically trap the tritium in the secondary cooling loop.  A problem, yes, but nothing major.

And of course there are the political issues.  An MSR doesn't fit into the """"razor-blade"""" business model currently employed, research is still needed, and that is expensive, waste reprocessing is currently illegal (though this is stupid when also applied to pyroprocessing), and uranium is too cheap these days to make a breeder economically viable.

(Yes, if we can find some agreement, I'll summarize this and move it to the article proper.)"""
0,"carlo, the point about collins is that he is making a general point about prestige ie wembley and us pro were over years the 2 most prestigous (the french dissappeared for more years than the other 2); he is not specifically referring to 1963. In 1963 with laver, rosewall hoad and gonzales in the us field you have the four great pros of the era anyway. Once laver joined in 1963 all 3 had strong fields every year; the absences of hoad say in 1965 from all 3 does not matter. Laver and rosewall won every major from 1963 onwards and were completely dominant. no other pro was ever a legitmate candidate for the top 2 spots. I admit all the sources I have are anglo saxon, but its clear aussies, brits and americans all had the same view - ie wembley and us pro the best.

Since this is not an article, but a sandbox draft, I don't know what to edit. I'll edit it here:

Note: You *almost got it right* but, the subject of the article is not the term, but the myth (or, shall we say controversy) about the term. The *argument* should be the subject.

""""Democrat Party"""" is a term used in the United States instead of """"Democratic Party"""" when referring to the Democratic National Committee. http://www.democrats.org/about/faq.html There is an ongoing dispute about the origins of this shorthand term, whether it is a natural shorthand expression, or whether it is derogatory to the party. A 1984 New York Times article suggested Republicans began to use the term when Democrats used their party name to infer """"they are the only true adherents of democracy.""""[1] New Yorker commentator Hendrik Hertzberg wrote that the term """"is a slur intended to ... express contempt.""""[2] He also stated that polling however indicated only """"deeply committed"""" Democrats found the term offensive.[2] Political analyst Charlie Cook attributed use of the term to force of habit rather than a deliberate epithet by Republicans.[3] Ruth Marcus stated that Republicans likely only continue to employ the term because Democrats dislike it.[2] Hertzberg and Marcus both state the use of the term is """"trivial"""".[2][3] [4]

History of usage
The earliest known use of the term, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, was by a London stock-market analyst, who wrote in 1890, """"Whether a little farmer from South Carolina named Tillman is going to rule the Democrat Party in America – yet it is this, and not output, on which the proximate value of silver depends.""""[5]

William Safire in [year] wrote about the use of the term, understood as a derogatory reference, and attributed it to Thomas Dewey who he credits with this usage.[6] The term gained popularity during the 1940 presidential campaign of Wendell Wilkie. Wilkie's campaign manager Harold Stassen said, regarding his use in the 1940s, that because the Democratic Party was controlled """"by Hague in New Jersey, Pendergast in Missouri and Kelly-Nash in Chicago, [it] should not be called a 'Democratic Party.' It should be called the 'Democrat Party.'""""[7]

Do you see the difference? All the way through, the dispute about the term should be the subject of the article, not whether it *really* means one thing or another.

There are two very obvious big groups, both easily characterised by their """"ancestry"""" - the kicking games descended from association rules and the carrying games descended from the rugby rules. The rest of the codes, all relatively minor in global terms, cannot be characterised by a single ancestry, and so shouldn't be. They are a group of games, some influenced by both soccer-type games and rugby school rules, with various influences within the group as well, that are most easily characterised by the fact that they are all Australian or Irish in origin.

 Lets start with the opening three paragraphs 

I think we put this version on the discussion page, FunkyFly had few concerns, we addressed them, and we should start with this version:

Macedonism (Bulgarian: Македонизъм, Macedonian and Serbian: Македонизам) is a term mostly used in Bulgaria, and to some extent Greece (Kofos) to describe the perceived negative aspects of Macedonian Nationalal Movement. In Bulgaria this term is used primarily by the nationalists to describe the Macedonian National Movement as a political ideology, or a regional linguistic separatist movement. In Greece this term is used almost exclusively by Kofos in the context of United Macedonia related subjects. In an extreme context, the word itself means that there is no authentic, but only an artificial Macedonian nationhood, an ideological mindset imposed by Yugoslav socialism (Macedonians = Bulgarian Macedonists) .

The term is chiefly a Balkan regionalism, rarely used in the English historiography. It is not found neither in Enciclopedia Britanica nor in the Oxford English Dictionary.

In the article The Macedonian Question published on 18th January 1871 in the """"Macedonia"""" newspaper in Constaninople by Petko Rachev Slaveikov, Makedonism was defined and critized, his adherants were named Macedonists, and this may be one of the earliest surviving references to it.

I sympathize that the idea of a big bang is difficult but the scaling paper does not get round it, at best it just gets the log of time so 0 becomes minus infinity at the cost of making a lot of other things much more complicated.

 Swastika as a mnemonic device http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html 

The article needs more information about the swastika's use as a modern mnemonic device. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Rex Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by the National Socialist German workers Party as alphabetic symbolism, including meshed """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism."""" The leader of German National Socialists at that time altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist"""" and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens.  Professor Curry showed that many modern myths use a false belief that Nazis called themselves """"Nazis.""""  The myths cause widespread ignorance of the eytmology of the word """"Nazi."""" Party members called themselves """"National Socialists,"""" not """"Nazis.""""  Dr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas use the false belief that Nazis called their symbol a """"swastika.""""  German National Socialists did not call their symbol a """"swastika.""""  Another person conceded the point with the comment that """"It does seem to be the case that the National Socialist German Workers' Party originated the 45° orientation...."""" though they did not necessarily originate that use, the German National Socialists did independently alter their use of the symbol for their specific desire to highlight the """"S"""" letter for """"socialism."""" Of course, the additional comment that they didn't use the 45 degree orientation consistently also concedes Professor Curry's work showing that their leader deliberately altered / evolved the symbol from its historic orientation into meshed """"S"""" letters for socialism. The graphic resonance is highly suggestive... and in fact it is compelling! In fact, one of the flags that Dr. Curry cites argues for that thesis: The swastika itself comprises two S's, and that is shown to have been known consciously when the German National Socialists overlay two additional S's for another group (as German National Socialists had other examples of similar alphabetic symbolism). Hitler even altered his own signature to reflect the same """"S"""" for socialism and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html The leader of the German Socialists had no reason to harp on this idea because he was an ex-artist. Nevertheless, he did allude to the alphabetic symbolism in his own comments in his notorious book. Of course, he would not drone on about it just as he did not drone on about what the stylized """"SA"""" symbol meant, or the side-by-side """"SS"""" symbol, or the """"VW"""" (all of which other writers concede for some inconsistent reason). The only reason it is so hard for most people to understand today is because they have been trained to use the hackneyed shorthand for the Party and most people are ignorant of the name of the actual Party, and thus have no idea that the Party actually espoused a dogma that they called """"Socialism."""" Even to this day, people repeatedly delete Dr. Curry's work in an effort to perpetuate the ignorance and the myths."""

Also, by being related to Arabs does not mean Maltese are necessarily Arabs and there are many Lebanese who seak Arabic, but also don't even consider themselves Arabs because of their distinct non-Arab ancestry, especially amongst Lebanese christians. Tunisians and other North Africans were largely Arabized in language and culture but are of non-Arab origins, and are of predominantly Berber origins and retain Berber culture, even among Arabized Berbers. Maltese speak a Semitic language and are of very significant Phoenician descent which clearly links them to Lebanese and also to Tunisians. Considering the Maltese language is a Semitic language very similar to Tunisian Arabic, obviously there would also be Arab cultural influences as well. They are related to all Arabs in terms of language, but are specifically very closely related to Lebanese and Tunisians due to common Pheoenician ancestry and also share many cultural aspects with Tunisians.

-TABSaving 300 000 lives against the odds, the pressure and the sheer logic, if one is criminally antisemitic through and through, is a fact sir. 
-TABDismantling the Iron Guard, a declared antisemitic and pro-german organization, is another paradox
-TABMarying a Jewish lady as an antisemit, doesn’t make sense
-TABAllowing the Jewish community to have official representatives, to befriend at least one of them, the lider of that community and to lend him an attentive ear and to let him convince you to change some of the previously issued orders and laws, does not, again, fit into an antisemitic profile. 
-TABAllowing some of the deported Jews in Transnistria to be repatriated, is not, again, an act of an atisemite. (It is another unprecedented act; can you quote one single similar occurrence in an Europe under the german boot?)

Please explain this. My request is NOT rethorical. I do agree on your superior erudition in the matter, for all I know, you might be a historian, whereas I am just interested in history. And PLEASE don’t refer me to other books, reports, authors. Just give me your own opinion on the points above. Not your opinion that they do not matter, but how do you explain them? I accept your patronizing unpleasant as it may be, if you’ll just explain. 

And try to see my point: I DO accept the possibility of being wrong. I try to stay as objective as I can, but till now, I heard rather unilateral accusations, rather than specific proofs and facts. That’s the diference between us, when confronted with discrepancies, you sir seem to deliberately ignore them, because the authors you read do so; me, I start my own research. I have spoken personally to at least 50 people, who lived through those terrible times, not Jewish, unfortunately, but certainly not antisemitic. (It’s not much, but at least I did it; what’s YOUR personal research ?) They are spread over all major Romanian regions, my witnesses, covering many different trades. Not one, mind you, ever heard, much less witnessed, any antisemitic violence ORDERED BY ANTONESCU or his government on Romania – old territory. Please quote contrary evidence, first hand if possible. I confess, I couldn’t find Jewish witnesses, all my Jewish friends and aquaintances are too young for that, but I’m still looking. 

And excuse me, the accusation of “incomplete quoting” the Wiesel repport is ludicrous. Would you want me to quote the full text ? My point was that even in a report that I consider unilateral and biased (like a trial with prosecutors only and without defenders), important facts like apparently inexplicable acts of mercy and a definite orriginal Jewish policy, totally opposed to that of Germany, at a time when Germany was still all powerfull, could not be remained unnoticed. The Wiesel Commission itself, sir, could not ignore those facts; how can you ? 

The Wiesel Report allowed such colossal mistakes as blaming a whole state, a whole nation, I remember of having read the phrase “the crimes committed by Antonescu and the Romanian nation against Jews”. You never blame a whole nation, a whole population. 

 The blame sir, is INDIVIDUAL, as Frederic Forsythe says. And so is the salvation. 

An intelligent man knows that when you deal with great numbers, you have to apply statistics, over-generalization is one of the  most unforgivable acts. And such a phrase lies in the same report in which there are mentioned pro-Jewish acts, both from government level and from individuals, only to underline that they don’t count. And you want me to take such a report as gospel truth, a model of impartiality and justice ?

MR MIRCION, kindly, get a grip on yourself. To state that Antonescu is “my hero” proves you didn’t even tried to read what I wrote; if so, how and what are you criticizing ? 

I repeat, to be sure Antonescu was involved in war crimes. Commited in war zones. He was not involved in crimes against humanity, in cold-blood premeditated murder, based on an ethnic cleansing policy, on the contrary, he tried, and partially succeeded to stop it, against considerable political pressure and certainly against the major antisemitic trend in a Germany dominated Europe. He is to be condemned, of course, but NOT for the wrong reasons. At the time of the reckoning, both good and bad deeds should be put in the balance. Romanians, sir, have the right to criticize, accuse, and condemn Antonescu. Not the Jewish people from Romania-old kingdom, since Antonescu saved 300 000 of them while sending almost half a million of his own people to their death. 

To be sure, this is just my opinion, but it’s based on facts.

Like myself, fans of Ms. Michaels are no doubt distressed by the petty actions of two Wikipedia usersMarauder40 and Hullaballoo Wolfowitzwho keep undoing my edits to this article. These two users constantly revert my edits with the claim that the article is too Peacock-y, and that it goes into too much depth about Ms. Michaels by detailing her rounds on the talk show circuit. I whole heartedly disagree. I think that her work on the various talk shows is some of the funniest, most impressive work of her career; and it is no small feat to appear on Ed Sullivan and The Tonight Show, let alone perform as well as she did. I hope the two editors who keep changing this article will realize this, and I encourage both of them to consider the possibility that only they, out of the countless editors on Wikipedia, have had any objections to the information on Ms. Michaels posted over the years. I don't know what their beef is with her, or if they have even seen any of her fine performances, but it would be appropriate for them to learn more about her before destroying the information about her on this free online encyclopedia."

0,"""You also make the following defamatory attack on my authority by claiming """"So she [Janet Marlow] is a more authoritative figure than Viktor, at this stage.""""  Your claim is based on nothing scholarly, only google hits and the fact that Marlow has self-published a method book. A method book, I might add, with proven misinformation contained therein. Among many errors in that book: In the front matter the author states falsely that """"Narciso Yepes [...] heard that there were four tones with less sustain due to missing sympathetic resonance on the six-string guitar"""". That is, even though Yepes ubiquitously indicates eight (not four) missing resonances in various articles and interviews as referenced here as well as in his Speech of Ingression into the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando delivered on 30 April 1989: """"The strings that I have added incorporate all the natural resonance that the instrument lacked in eight of the twelve notes of the equal tempered scale."""" 

Despite discussing this last issue with you numerous times, you still made the folowing statement: """"there is no misinformation on the particular page to which I linked. Both sides are describing the same eight notes being provided by the same four resonant strings. Whether that is four """"resonances"""" or eight is a non-issue.""""  That is, even though eight clearly does not equal four and both sides are clearly not describing the same thing, you still defend your support of misinformation.

Even though I've explained this before, and my site explains it in detail, I will say it again:

The western musical scale has 12 notes per octave. On the guitar, Yepes observed, four of these when palyed on a treble string induced a unison resonance from a bass string. These four notes are E, A, B, and D. If any octave of any of these notes is played on a treble string, a bass string reproduces it in unison. If A5 is played, A5 is reproduced by resonance on a bass string. Yepes observed that the other eight notes do not have the same resonance. These are C, C#, D#, F, F#, G, G#, A#. By adding four strings to the guitar tuned a singular way (C, A#, G#, F#), all twelve notes of the octave, played anywhere on the treble strings, now have unison resonances from bass strings. If C#4 is played C#4 is reproduced on string 10 (F#). If F#4 is palyed, F#4 is reproduced on strign 10 by resonance. If both C#4 and F#4 ar played, string 10 produces both the pitch of C#4 and the pitch of F#4 simultaneously. This is a proven fact of acoustics.

If Janet Marlow claims there are only """"four missing resonances on the six string guitar"""" (and in her book even attributes this to """"Narciso Yepes""""), it is totally false. Yepes said eight missing resonances (C, C#, D#, F, F#, G, G#, A#) not four (C, Bb, Ab, Gb). Marlow knows that because she has (in Soundboard magazine) referenced an interview with Yepes (Snitzler, L. 1978. """"Narciso Yepes: The 10-String Guitar: Overcoming the Limitations of Six Strings"""". Guitar Player 12: p. 26.) in which Yepes very clearly indicates which notes do and do not have resonance. Yet she has published at least twice the disinformation that Yepes added four strings (resonators) because four resonances were missing.

If you still have a problem understanding this, I am happy to meet with you and illustrate it on an actual 10-string guitar, since you've never owned/played one.

Contradiction between sources
Hi all. For now, I've removed this:

In 1840, an orthodox Jewish community constituted the largest single religious group in the city.Grenville, John Ashley Soames. A history of the world from the 20th to the 21st century; Routledge, 2005. pg. 456. ISBN 0415289556

I cannot access the text and would like to see it. I also think picking 1840 is arbitrary.  This source which provides a population table for Jerusalem from 1806 - 1945 on page 28 indicates that in 1838 the population was 11,500 people (4,500 Muslims, 3,500 Christians, and 3,000 Jews); in 1846 the population was 17,173 (6,100 Muslims, 3,558 Christians, and 7,515 Jews) and that in 1851 it was 25,354 (12,286 Muslims, 7,488 Christians, and 5,580 Jews). Given the city had become an important administrative capital for the Ottoman empire in the 19th century, its not suprising that there were new arrivals all the time from all three religious groups.

When I say that the head of state has no power to act outside his kingdom in an article titled """"personal jurisdiction"""" it most certainly cannot be construed that he cant do ANYTHING in that other state, what is said has to be read in light of the subject being spoken of. Otherwise you can have absolutely ridiculous interpretations of what I have said. By that sense, any and every action of the head of state outside the territory would be illegal, thats insane.

 I know as I have not been able to find out how many amps the receiver and transmitter drew is what happened on the flight to Hawaii. We know about when the generator went off line and we know when they landed. The rest is deduction. What I cannot tell you is if they were down on an island on their belly, (see Lambrechts opinion of landing chances on Gardener) how long they could operate their radios. Or if their electrical system would have been intact enough to function. I grew up in the age of the vacuum tube and know that it would take a minute or two - to 'warm' up the dynamotor and transmitter to the point where it would achieve full power. This is all assuming they had no serious damage to the airplane. My 'best guess"""" (OPINION, don't ask me to put it in the article) is that they probably had at least one hour of operation. The other question is how much """"gain"""" they would have gotten from a """"less than optimum"""" (to quote the TIGHAR radio guy) length under 1/8 wave, V-type antenna sitting less than six feet off the ground. The answer is probably - but not definitely - not much. We are looking at an actual output from the antenna of perhaps 10-20 watts with a horizontal polarity and bad angle. Perhaps they were heard. Odds are they were not. (I repeat this is OPINION). Still we need to consider these things. My guess is that Earhart (OPINION) could have transmitted and received for at least 1 hour. That she could have done one or the other longer. One must remember that a dynamotor was a pretty inefficient means of turning low DC voltage into high voltage AC for radio communications, thus the receiver alone would have more operational life than the transmitter (once again, we do not know how many minutes the xmitter or receiver were on during the Hawaii flight, but a good guess is that they both ran all the time). That the propagation characteristics of her antenna and the frequencies she was able to operate on severely limited any possible range. I find it far easier to think that reports of a 'weak carrier"""" or 'feeble and unintelligible"""" communications being hear are far more likely than someone who claimed to hear her 4/5.

The bottom line - in my humble (and we all know how humble I am) - opinion is that given the best of circumstances, they would have had at least one hour of radio time left if they were out of fuel. """

0,"Important clarification to add: Processor vs Core Microsoft definitions 

Page shall contain the exact definition of what a processor is, microsoftly speaking. Indeed, this concept is quite blur if we refer to the numerous pages from different Microsoft web sites.

For instance, at http://www.microsoft.com/technet/windowsserver/evaluate/features/compare.mspx, we can find:
Windows 2003 Server Standard x64 R2 (64 bits):
- 4-way symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support

Other example for the same Windows Server 2003 R2 Standard x64 Edition at http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/64bit/x64/standard.mspx
- memory-bound applications that do not require more than four processors.
- supports up to 32 GB of RAM on 1- to 4-way servers.
- Windows Server 2003 R2 Standard x64 Edition supports up to four CPUs on one server)

If we refer to Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_multiprocessing, multiprocessor architecture or multicore processor are both SMP architecture. Thus, by speaking sometimes about 4 processors support, sometimes about 4-way SMP support, Microsoft confuses us all.
Coming to a Quadri 4-cores based server (16 SMP), this leads to go from a Standard edition (4 processors support) to a DataCenter edition (4x4=16 SMP support), thus raising the license price as for no less than +700%."

I'll try to take the points in turn. Hope I get this format right.
 - WP:BLPGOSSIP states that Be wary of sources that use weasel words and that attribute material to anonymous sources. I am not aware of any weasel words or attribution to anonymous sources. I am not sure how the section applies, if you could be more clear it would be helpful.
 - The phrase involve claims about third parties is so vague as to not be any assistance. By this metric, so little can be used that it's almost meaningless. Someone stating their birthdate, or the grade school they attended. But for a person saying """"I have a conflict with Jenny Smith over Issue X"""" - where do we draw the line? It could easily be said that an actor and actress divorcing, with one placing on their personal (publicist) website a statement about """"separating for reasons of X"""" is a """"claim about third parties"""", but I wouldn't argue it is unreliable nor unencyclopedic to include in the biography of either individual. One can take things too far, and I think in this case the avoidance of even mentioning the existence of dispute is getting to the point where people are being literalist and not using their common sense. 76.31.236.91  20:51"""

Your contributed article, Carlos Vives discography
 Hello, I notice that you recently created a new page, Carlos Vives discography. First, thank you for your contribution; Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of volunteers such as yourself. Unfortunately, the page you created covers a topic on which we already have a page - Carlos Vives. Because of the duplication, your article has been tagged for speedy deletion. Please note that this is not a comment on you personally and we hope you will to continue helping improve Wikipedia. If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at Carlos Vives - you might like to discuss new information at the article's talk page. 

If you think that the article you created should remain separate, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag - if no such tag exists then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hangon tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that they  userfy the page or have a copy emailed to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the article creation process and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia.

 I was thinking about this last night, and came to two conclusions: First, focusing solely on this article is not the way to go. I need to go back to square one and add academic rigor (if possible) to global warming and denialism. [Don't tell me GW is FA and is therefore academically rigorous; the FA star does not even come within discus-throwing distance of establishing an article as """"academically rigorous.""""]. Second, your system of defending this Wikipedia page (notice I didn't say """"article"""") is completely airtight, because you hold control over all of the definitions. Join any high school debate team and they'll tell you, if you own the definitions, you own the debate. And the problem here is this: you define anyone who disagrees with AGW as a """"denialist""""; and you define everyone who agrees with you as an """"expert."""" Done! The page is impregnable. Take forex the quote by Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer. Using her comments as supporting evidence of the page's (not """"article's) thesis is a flagrant act of POV that proves this page (not """"article"""") is an op-ed piece from start to end. Barbara Boxer is a politician. Every bit of power, money and prestige she has comes from her ability to do one thing and thing only: to characterize herself as a noble public servant, and stereotype her opponents as villains, buffoons or both. Even more — and this is important — Barabara Boxer is not a run-of-the-mill politician. It would be nearly impossible to find someone more unwaveringly partisan than she is. In short, the Boxer quote is another bit that does not come close to passing the """"so what?"""" test. I intend to delete that one sometime soon too. I also wonder whether I should give one of those damn wikicookie templates as a thank-you to the editors who revert me, every time they do so. Or maybe a barnstar?

 Comment from Homosexuality (workspace) 

Actually, my citation can be the very same 2000 Breedlove study that our friend in Farmington includes in Fetal hormones and sexual orientation. Background is that length of ring finger relative to index finger is strongly correlated with fetal testosterone levels. That fact is rather well established quite apart from sexual orientation. Breedlove found an additional much weaker correlation between implied fetal testosterone and sexual orientation, with lesbians in particularly being most strongly androgynized. It's definitely interesting. Gay men show the same pattern (gays more androgynized), but to a smaller degree.

However, there is a huge overlap between the suggested fetal testosterone levels and sexual orientation. That is, on average of a bunch of lesbians had higher fetal testosterone than a paired group of straight women. But many lesbians had lower fetal testosterone than the straight-woman average. And many straight women had higher fetal testosterone than the lesbian average. The standard deviation within each group is much more than the mean difference between the groups.

So what does it show? Well, I dunno. There's something potentially interesting there, especially if it can be replicated in much larger samples. But it's hardly clear causation, nor even clear correlation. What it amounts to might be something like (purely hypothetically): """"High testesterone exposure female fetuses have a 10% chance of becoming lesbian; low testosterone exposure female fetuses have a 5% chance of becoming lesbian."""" But that's about the strongest conclusion I can imagine coming out of this (and it hasn't yet, it's been suggested), and that's a relatively weak factor.

Lot's of people try to do the two step process and say that it applies to all talk page discussions (which is wrong) and also try to create a situation of """"my unsourced opinion wins unless you meet the very high bar of finding a wp:rs that addresses and refutes my unsourced opinion""""  Which is what both of you are trying to do here with your assertion that the two terms are synonymous. So such is invalid on several levels.  Sincerely, North8000  """

Greetings,

I would like to raise an issue regarding the 'Cambodia' page where you reverted an deletion I made. I don't know weither you thought my IP was a robot randomly deleting part of articles in wikipedia, I can assure you I'm not )

If you carefully look at what I deleted (and the reasons why I did it, see in the discussion page on the article), you will hopefuly understand my motives and remove once more what I considered a paragrap that goes against the neutral pov policy of wikipedia.

 This CWCC story should go in wikinews as far as I'm conserned, it's an on-going story.
 I'm living in Cambodia since 2 years and while I've heard more than once stories of perpetrators buying the families of the victims to drop the charges and make false testimonies, this on-going story does not represent the general picture in the case. Right now the paragraph offers only one very subjective point-of-view, is focussed only on one case rather than trying to be general (like the article 'Cambodia' should be), and relies on only 1 more or less reliable news source
 The 'Cambodia' entry should not be used to try to make a point and help a person getting out of jail in a corrupted country.

Please remove this badly written paragraph that goes against the ethic code of wikipedia. Thanks ( )"

 HighKing 
Re. this and this. To put it bluntly, you don't know what you're talking about Murry. First, the IP is not me logging out to edit. HighKing has more than one person who objects to his edits, and rightly so. And second, HighKing was specifically warned by Cailil not to use his own interpretation of sources in making policing edits like this, which is exactly what he did by altering a direct quote that no longer existed on a page to read something else based on what he read in the banner, which has nothing to do with the quote. That is not policy compliant either in letter or spirit. His only policy based options were to remove it, or change the citation to point to where he subsequently found it. He did neither. His alteration of the quote was wrong, and his editting of the page to reflect the current contents of the cite, while not wrong in of itself, falls squarely under Cailil's other warnings. As an aside, in claiming the original author is the person who breached MOSQUOTE, you seem to be assuming that the error in locating the cite for the quote was down to the original author. I see no reason why that should be. It's far more likely that it was moved after the original author used that page as the cite for it. At the end of the day Murry, you're not doing HighKing any favours by defending him in this manner, and in doing so, you might even find yourself under scrutiny from Cailil for engaging in the same behaviour. I suggest you read the entire extended discussion under """"Removals of the term British Isles (again) on HighKing's talk page very carefully, lest you find yourself making the same errors in judgement he is making.

0,"""

My overview

1. Intro: Euskadi ta Askatasuna is translated as Basque Homeland and Freedom, yet Euskadi (a neologism) is surely better translated as Basque Country, in the territorial and political sense of the term """"country"""". The term homeland is kind of totally out of place, as happens in some other article. There's no real equivalent for homeland in Basque or Spanish and sounds very strange. 

2. Aims: Mountolive seemed to insist in claiming (erroneously) that ETA's principal aim is to create a socialist state. This is not real, has been discussed before and can be documented. The current status is ok.

3. Secondary tactical targets: 
Drug traffickers (this has a """"citation needed"""" mark). I can't provide the citation but can say that in the early 80s it was the case. 
I would like a source for the Leitzaran highway, a more recent case, that I think is not so clear though. 
Possibly the complex struggle of Lemoiz nuclear plant needs its own article but well... there are no doubts that at some point ETA took it as their own circustantial fight and actually were decissive in stopping its construction. This may well justify a section of its own for this particular case but a separate article is maybe a better solution.

4. Context: the entry is ok as for now, unless someone has a better idea. There was a minor dispute about wether Askatasuna (former GG.AA./AAT) should be defined as """"anti-repressive"""" or just stated without any explanation. 

5. Social support is a little confuse and maybe POV. There's much emphasis on Francoism, what is surely justified, but the division Navarre+Araba vs. Guipuscoa+Biscay is interpreted from the Francoist POV more or less. After all, whatever the support that fascists had in Navarre and Araba, they fell in that side because of where the coup triumphed. There were only three cities in all Spain where the coup was aborted: Madrid, Barcelona and St. Sebastian (plus partially Toledo and Oviedo), the rest just fell where they got in luck. In this sense sentences like Since some Basque nationalists had sided with the Republican government in the Spanish Civil War, Franco restricted virtually any public expressions of Basque culture... are very tendentious. Francoism attempted and partly suceeded in emphasizing the divisions between the provinces with such tactics as declaring Biscay and Guipuscoa """"traitor provinces"""" but not Madrid, Barcelona, Santander or Murcia, that were also in the Republican side. 

The last paragraph of this section is also confuse. It's not clear what erosion may have suffered """"MLNV"""" (acronym is not clear for the English reader) in recent years. Sources are needed but HB-EH-Batasuna-EHAK support has oscilated between 18% and 12% (in all Southern Basque Country, Navarre included, where this sector is the largest nationalist one), with ups and downs, and is difficult to count in some elections because of the ban on Batasuna and anything of the like. 

The claims on Iparralde are rather false. More than 10% voted nationalist (mostly AB) in latest elections. But regionalism (claim for a separate Basque departement, greater presence of Basque language in administration, economic institutions, etc.) is widespread, being promised by politicians of all parties in each election and rejected by Paris right after them.

6. Tactics: I reviewed this part and mostly is ok. There's the problem of redundancy between tactics and victims and it seems Mountolive had a different approach, that has been partly discussed above.

7. Government response: the treatment of unionist paramilitary groups is too focused on the GAL ignoring once important GCE and BVE) and I'd like to see some material on the following:
Dispersion of ETA prisioners, history of it and its effects on militant prisioners and their relatives and friends (at least a mention to all those dead in car accidents while travelling to visit their imprisioned relatives). 
Recent legal and judicial steps on practical life terms
General replacement of Spanish police corps by Basque Ertzantza (in the BAC) and its influence.

The rest is ok, I think, though maybe the 18/98 procedure and the derivated ones need an article for themselves. I'd like also more info on the closed newspapers, radios and magazines, tortures to journalists of Egunkaria ([http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=10179 reporters sans frontiers 2004 report). 

I think you can retire """"controversial"""" from Garzón - though I insist that he's actually quite controversial in fact, I admit it may break WP:NPOV.

8. Structure: it's difficult to expand due to the secretivity of the organization but some comments:

You're right Milo.  A consensus of scientists in the scientific field of parapsychology.  Only that. Wikipedia follows the scientific consensus in the field. We don't ask psychologists what the conditions are inside a neutron star.  We really don't care what they have to say.  And of course, we would present the viewpoints of the critics of parapsychology, and more so than with other articles on science.  I have absolutely no desire not to accurately present what the critics have to say.

Even if I were pushing parapsychology, I still would not try to censor the critics, because that would only detract from my case- the reader would be able to tell it was a whitewash.

It seems like Ivan Stambuk and 'Ceha' are 2 lonely fighters for some irrational nationalistic lies about the South Slavic languages, constantly fighting with the rest of the world, ha, ha. He (Ivan Stambuk) is also creating some ridiculous and partial maps showing only a half of the Shtokavian speaking area (the other half is spread through Serbia and Montenegro)

Please, if you can, do something to stop this VANDALISM by Ivan Stambuk and Ante Perkovic on the above mentionned wikipedia articles and discussion pages, and if necessary, please BAN them for a longer time, so they won't damage wikipedia with their lies and misinformations. Their senseless cro-nationalism is the last thing wikipedia and the world needs; they may only keep it to their isolated circles of their fewer and fewer supporters. Thank you very much and greetings to you.

Thanks, that may at least defuse things a little.  

My personal thought is that if this is to get any mention on Ferdinand or Ferry Porsche's page the text should relate to them directly, rather than being the same cut and paste sentence.  

Mentioning that Ferdinand Porsche gets most of the popular credit for a lot of things that were actually as much or more a product of his employees, and pointing out that this is common practice in the design industry  the boss gets the credit  would be a bit more NPOV.  Mentioning Komenda as one of those who gets overlooked in favor of the boss would be OK for me too.

 22:46, 28 Oct 2003 (UTC)

Before I get any further on this subject, I would like clarificaton about the relative roles of Ferdinand and Ferry in this issue.  I would like to see the fact of Ferdinand's univolvement nailed down before I approach the matter of Ferry, or before I try to address the simple revert battle now going on here.

The bulk of the story clearly belongs on the Komenda page.  A one-sentence reference on the Ferry page saying that Ferry's claim is disputed is appropriate, and it should then refer those who want more on the story to the Komenda page.  01:57, 2003 Oct 29 (UTC)

This is the situation that I think is the truth, from my reading.  When Ferdinand Porsche set up an independent engineering consultancy in Germany (in the 30s?) although he was the company founder and head engineer he employed a number of other engineers - the jobs were too big for just one man.  Among the men he employed was Erwin Komenda, who had previously worked for Daimler-Benz and before that Steyr.  Komenda was an expert in auto body construction and the engineering of pressed sheet metal bodywork, that I can determine.  

Ferdinand Porsche's field of expertise seems to have been the mechanical aspects of vehicles, engines and the like, and the overall team direction.  Komenda worked on the bodywork of the KDF-wagen (later to become the Beetle) among others.  Komenda definitely worked on translating ideas for the basic shape into sheet metal and the detail design of the bodywork.  Many of the plans and patent applications from this period are signed by Komenda and applied for with his name on them.  Whether his were the first pencil sketches that were turned into auto bodies I am less sure.  It's certainly possible that they were, though I am sure others in the team including Ferdinand Porsche had a lot of input.

JUST A THOUGHT:

Shouldn't this page consider division into chapters:

(i.e.)
Early Life
WWI
WWII

Porche is a fascinating man with a career so linked with the World Wars  but that almost seems lost and in this bio. His involvement in WWII with the Nazis in both the Racing circuit and in the War effort really shaped his life and that that of the world. He represents a true place in history - so perhaps a chapter insersion could better work here.  Just a suggestion.
DH - 10/16/05
Postwar, Porsche's son Ferry and the other engineers who had worked for Ferdinand during the war came together (initially in Austria) to design cars.  Ferdinand was imprisoned until 1949 for war crimes relating to the use of slave labor in projects he worked on.

Between them, a car was designed that became the Porsche 356.  Komenda played a big part in this.  It would be incorrect to say that he was the designer, per se, because he only worked on the bodywork.  However, its construction was his, and probably much of its styling.  He also worked in a similar capacity for later Porsche cars.

What I think needs to be done is to write more about Ferdinand's consultancy and Ferry's postwar sports car company so Komenda can be placed in his proper context.  WHen part of a larger article it will seem less 'heavy'.

Protected

In this case, it's rather difficult to revert to a pre-edit-war version. Since there's no getting around the fact that I agree with Wik that the link should not be included, I have protected the page on a version including the link, to avoid the perception of bias.

Rousseff was never a member of the VPR. At that time - 1968 - she was a member of another organization called COLINA. She would later join VAR Palmares in 1969. Therefore, there are absolutely no links, whatsoever, between Rousseff and the assassination of Charles Chandler."

 Sound media in Bach article 

Hello Michael Bednarek, I've just seen you have reverted the inclusion of sound media samples in the article. I understand that, being in a block, it did interfere with the article layout. However, I invite you to reconsider some kind of media inclusion ( it can be in smaller one sample blocks): notice that this is an article about a musical genius, which gave space to every picture of Bach and family.

Albania Veneta

Dear Jimbo, 

I appreciate very much what you are doing with your Wikipedia. It is a great gift to all of us. But there are some """"points"""" that need to be improved, as you know. 

One is the presence of nationalistic groups that in a coordinate way want to impose their points of view without regard of what write serious historians. They usually proceed to ask for help from """"friendly to them"""" administrators and so obtain what they want. In Eastern Europe there are many of these groups (mainly ex-communists) and often are associated with hackers. 

What do we have to do with these nationalistic groups? In my case I can pinpoint what is going on with the articles """"Albania Veneta"""", """"Zadar"""", """"Istrian exodus"""", etc., where a group of known nationalistic fanatics (like one nicknamed in the english wikipedia as """"Direktor"""") are erasing and damaging what write others with serious and proven references. They use the typical misinformation with """"political pressure"""" of the Soviets in Eastern Europe. 

May be you have a serious and impartial administrator, who can help? 
Regards. 

This seems to be a dispute about naming conventions and reliable sources. Naming convention disputes should be solved by determining the names most often used by English speakers and using them without regard to ethnic sympathies. Disputes concerning reliable sources should be raised on WP:RSN. When different reliable sources disagree, they should both be represented in the article with a description of the differences in order to satisfy WP:NPOV. It seems likely that both sides of this dispute have relatively equally reliably sources which conflict.  Welcome to the Balkans. ←BenB4 """

With regards to his latest comment, what does Malta's size have to do with the inclusion of an article about its historical nobility? And what about this earlier comment, and I quote: ...the whole reason a Royal Commission was appointed in the first place to sort out Maltese titles was because a whole whopping lot of people demanded recognition of this title and that purportedly granted to some ancestor or another by the crowned head of some ephemeral state or another. It'd also be interesting to know why the British bothered at all, instead of dismissing the whole business as gimcrackery from a tiny island with a contemporaneous population similar to Southwark, which would have been consistent behavior from them. 
These comments are insulting on every level; these are not polite things to say, especially from somebody who obviously has no idea what they are talking about.

 practice is enlightenment
In Zen terms we say honsho myoshu. Honsho means intrinsic enlightenment; myoshu, subtle practice. We say practice and enlightenment, or realization, are one. How is it one thing? When you sit, your zazen is the zazen of the Buddhas. Your zazen is sitting Buddha, or Buddha's zazen. So your practice is realization itself, enlightenment itself. Your zazen becomes anuttara samyak sambodhi itself. Have this kind of faith. 
Usually when you do zazen, zazen becomes a cause to create some kind of effect, such as enlightenment, frustration, anger, or whatever arises. That is the wrong way to do zazen. Your practice is not something by which you attain some place else or something else. Your practice itself is a fulfillment of honsho myoshu, the originally enlightened life."

It was said """"Will be archived: If you ever want to return, Jimbo can discuss this message (and your ADMINISTRATORS comment below) from his talk-page archives."""" I don't even know what that means. Here is my reply to the person that said that. And then the thing that was archived. The longer article was deleted off the page I put it on. I will glance back at my talk page to see if you have anything to say on this matter. If not I understand that it is not your issue. I would though prefer if you looked at it since that was my point, that people in power beneath you seem to want to bite the newbie to the point that the newbie is leaving and not coming back. They even suggested that my issue was with the WP:3RR rule which was not the issue. As a newbie I didn't know about that, and learned my lesson. It was with the time on the talk page being attacked by a WP:GANG / WP:TAGTEAM which are supported by administrators. So the person who archived my comments of your talk page didn't even get the point. Once I was told of the WP:3RR rule I never even touched the article again. Anyway hopefully you will actually read this before someone else finds a WP:XXXX rule as an excuse to delete it. 86.93.139.223  

So you understand, I had 3 days of a block to read the many WP:XXXX that were thrown at me, to then understand them. So while it might be hard for you to believe that someone can read in 3 days a bunch of WP:XXXX rules, it is not impossible. Actually I didn't have to read many, just the ones that were used against me to have me blocked. As I found, they were being totally misquoted against me. So yeah, you might find it hard to believe, you might also want to go to the Alkaline Diet article and look at how many people said exactly the same thing as I did in the past on the article. Is that hard to believe? Don't bother answering, just know that you might want to look at the history and deal with it. I don't understand why this was taken off Jimbo Wales' page by someone other than him with a note hard to believe. Isn't that his choice? Yes I would like him to discuss it with me. As I put it on his page with the express comment that the people (like you) who are in between him and me are the problem. So you making a personal judgement that someone can't read a few Wiki WP:XXXX rules in 3 days gives you the right to ignore my very detailed comments. Sorry but this is exactly the reason I contacted Jimbo and not you. Maximus. 86.93.139.223 (talk)  86.93.139.223  

Dear Jimbo, This is a part of a longer post on the Alkaline Diet page called Harry Potter is a Girl. As I am a newbie I don't know how to do links so copied it here. Sorry for taking your space up on your talk page. Also sorry for WP:TLDR. Please delete this if it is of no interest to you. I can't know what is and what is not of interest to you, and following WP:BOLD I am making my statement and you can decide what to do next. I have put it here as I wanted you to know of my experience here at Wikipedia and how after a few days due to repeated WP:BITE I am leaving Wikipedia editing never to return. Because the people between you and me are the problem I thought to go straight to the top. Sometimes the people at the top don't get told what is going on below them. Anyway thanks for Wikipedia. Good luck and perhaps reduce the number of rules / guidelines as I think they are being manipulated and misused. Maximus 86.93.139.223 (talk)  Will be archived: If you ever want to return, Jimbo can discuss this message (and your ADMINISTRATORS comment below) from his talk-page archives. See more comments further below. -Wikid77  THE ADMINISTRATORS: Dear administrators. As I am leaving Wiki editing after three days of being involved in it. I shall leave you with this information which I doubt you will read or care about, for my own self respect that I said it. I made a comment about the user Ronz for the administrator WormTT to read. As a newcomer to Wikipedia I followed the WP:BOLD rules and made a comment with uncertainty. I did not know if it was appropriate or not and I explained that with the very clear """"Sorry if this is not the appropriate way to communicate this, and please fell free to delete and ignore this message if that is the case.""""

hi there

Storm of the century is one of my favourite movie so I did some research a few years ago about the character Legion. He is a demon from hell ( as describe in the bible ) but if I'm not mistaken, he should be a wizzard according to the movie. 

Hint in the movie:

1) he hissed in the back of Mike's truck
2) the eyes: once black, then glowing red
3) the silver walking cane with a wolf head (wolf, an animal often associate with wizzards)

From the clues above, I reckon he's more of a wizzard then a demon."

Sorry to disagree again, but the article in question clearly puts the story forth as what each side says. (Narconon says drugs can be sweated out, doctors say no, etc.) How Dr. Touretzky took the story is not actually relevant, more on that at the end.
There are four basic """"sides"""" depicted in it, on one side Narconon and Scientology on the opposite Science and Ex-members/critics. The stuff on Touretzky's site is supported by the latter, and disputed by the former. To a neutral observer, like the Chronicle, it's a subject of controversy. (That's what ChrisO was saying.)
To explain why Dr. Touretzky's opinion of the story is irrelevant, I'll compare it to a reverse hypothetical situation; lets say Narconon felt that they had been quoted out of context. Both arguments are equally invalid since a paper isn't expected to publish what the subject wants published. (Actually, it's really similar to the lawsuit Barbara Schwarz filed against the Salt Lake City Tribune when they published her story and interview.)  

 On POV expressed in this and related articles on Wikipedia 

Incidentally, this article is an excellent example of the best case scenario of POV in a CoS/Hubbard article. It presents both sides arguments without additional comment by the paper, but unlike the Narconon/CoS claims, proof exists to back the assertions made by science. For example *Narco/tology's belief that all drugs have long longevity in fat, scrambling of 3D pictures, etc. compared to tests on human fat showing otherwise and the 3D picture theory to be unproven.
*Narconon and Scientology are for the purposes of the US Government separate entities and this abbreviation is not meant to imply otherwise. They do however share similar vocabulary and ideas, and when describing these I have chosen to abbreviate.  """

Yurica's POV is that the Heubeck article promotes the use of deception. I just skimmed it and if there was anything in it promoting deception, I may have overlooked it. I did however find a quote about exalting """"objective truth"""", which I have added to the article.

Note, however, that I do not want the article to say that Yurica is wrong. That would violate NPOV - something I've never advocated. The article should remain neutral on the question of whether Weyrich or Heubeck advoacate deception. 

It should balance Yurica's interpretation of the Heubeck article (her POV) with the opposing POV (if there are no facts) or the facts if there are any.

0,"Most of the material on the page was from a rewrite I did a few month ago. I am busy so I do not have time to work on the article so I will just give a few short notes on your rewrite. To be honest I have some issues with your edits. I answered you question above and fixed your error in the introduction of the article. 

There are two methods to define the topology of a LCTVS space: using a family of seminorms and using a local basis of locally convex, balanced and absorbend sets. Both methods should be present in the article on equal terms. The family of seminorms is useful to view LCTVS as generalizations of normed vector spaces. The definition in terms of a local base is useful if you are coming from the more abstract topological vector space concept.

The definition section is now too long and detailed. I think the subject is specialized enough so that we can assume the reader is familiar with the basic concepts which are now explained in detail in the definition.

The article was not perfect before but you introduced errors and made the article less readable, at least from my perspective."

I didn't write the sentence about the biblical references, I merely supplied them. I don't remember who  wrote the sentence.  However, a federal circuit court, wrote, (one of my deleted references):

The following was excerpted from Iannaccone v. Law, 142 F.3d 553 (2d Cir. 1998):

The right to proceed pro se in civil actions in federal courts is guaranteed by 28 U.S.C. § 1654, which provides: """"In all courts of the United States the parties may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel as, by the rules of such courts, respectively, are permitted to manage and conduct causes therein."""" Section 1654's guarantee derives directly from the Judiciary Act of 1789.

First introduced in the Senate on June 12, 1789 as part of Senate Bill [S-1], the right to self-representation appeared in section 31 of the Bill. But when the Bill became law, on September 24, 1789, the right was moved to section 35, which reads as follows: """"That in all the Courts of the United States the Parties may plead and manage their own causes personally or by the assistance of such Counsel or Attornies at law as by the rules of the said Courts respectively shall be permitted to manage and conduct causes therein."""" V Documentary History of the First Federal Congress of the United States of America 1789-1791 1150, 1165, 1193 (1986). As can be seen, the right to self-representation has remained constant for over 200 years.

The framers of our Constitution thought self-representation in civil suits was a basic right that belongs to a free people. Although the Supreme Court alluded to civil pro se representation in Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 812-13 (1975), the Court there focused its discussion on the right to represent oneself as a defendant in a criminal case, id. at 813 et seq., which the Constitution's Bill of Rights guarantees.

In a criminal prosecution, a pro se party of course may only appear as a defendant. In a civil case, a person may appear pro se as either a plaintiff or defendant. And, as noted, the right of self-representation in one case is protected by the Constitution, and in the other, simply by statute. Further, in contrast to criminal defendants, civil litigants unable to afford counsel cannot ordinarily obtain appointment of counsel, except in circumstances when there is a risk of loss of liberty, as in mental commitment or juvenile delinquency proceedings. See H.B. Kim,Legal Education For the Pro Se Litigant: A Step Towards a Meaningful Right to Be Heard, 96 Yale L. J. 1641, 1646-47 (1987).

Moreover, the historical origins of self-representation in civil and criminal proceedings are different. In Faretta, the Court discussed the historic requirement of having counsel, going back to the infamous English Star Chamber that forced counsel upon an unwilling defendant in a criminal proceeding, and the requirement's gradual reform. This reform was fervently embraced in colonial America for those accused of crime. See Faretta, 422 U.S. at 821-26.

Passing from the criminal to the civil context, we . . . observ[e] that a person appearing pro se in federal court can be a mixed blessing because persons appearing pro se lack legal training and may, on occasion, burden the court by filing illogical or incomprehensible pleadings, affidavits and briefs. And sometimes a pro se litigant appears simply for the purpose of using the courtroom to advance a political or social agenda, or to pursue a matter that is legally unredressable. See E.J.R. Nichols, Preserving Pro Se Representation in an Age of Rule 11 Sanctions, 67 Tex. L. Rev. 351, 351 nn.2 & 3 (1988). Yet, even given those potential burdens, there still remains a citizen's right of access to the courts, a strongly held notion stretching back to the beginnings of our Republic. The origins of the right to appear for oneself in civil proceedings derive from a number of sources, all deeply rooted in our history and culture. We undertake to discuss briefly five of those sources, though doubtless there are others:

First, history. Under the English common law with its complicated forms of action and veritable maze of writs and confusing procedures, the right to retain counsel in civil proceedings became a necessity. By the middle of the thirteenth century, lawyers so monopolized the courts in London that the King was forced to decree that, except for a few special causes, litigants were entitled to plead their own cases without lawyers. See The Right to Counsel in Civil Litigation, 66 Colum. L. Rev. 1322, 1325 (1966).

Second, mistrust of lawyers made appearance in court without benefit of counsel the preferred course. See A.L. Downey, Note, Fools and Their Ethics: The Professional Responsibility of Pro Se Attorneys, 34 B.C. L. Rev. 529, 533 (1993). Lawyers had no position of honor or place in society in early colonial days. The pioneers who cleared th"

As I wrote:
When this arbcom started at 21 January 2010, we were at 52,000 unreferenced BLPs, today we are at 45,000. That is 7,000 articles we as a community have referenced in 17 days, and the pace will only increase as more wikiprojects get involved. I can reference 40 articles in a day, 1/3 of the 124 proposed, this is very doable folks.
I would strongly encouarge you to support this proposal. It is very doable. 
I am actively working to notify other wikiprojects of several tools, see for example:
User_talk:The-Pope#Your_idea_at_Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment.2FBiographies_of_living_people 
As User:The-Pope wrote on my talk page:
The WP:Australia project had a list of over 2000 names just over 2 weeks ago. It's now under 900.  900 is still fairly unworkable, so we've split them up again into smaller topics. Other lists have popped up, Cricket, Rugby union, India and probably many more.   This is all do-able, but it does take time, it does get a bit boring, it can be tempting for some editors to put the first google hit they see on it and remove the tag, but it can work.  One other good thing about these lists, is that you can use the related changes link to see all edits to them... great to keep an eye on pages without clogging up your watchlist (almost like having multiple watchlists). 
This is very possible. As an editor who strives to save almost all articles for the past 4 years, and who has fought so many policy argument to keep articles, this is a wonderful comprimise, with so much potential, I would hope that you would seriously consider this proposal.

 Hello there Peter,

 I don't tend watch other users talk pages since my watchlist is already quite stuffed, and because some talk pages receive a lot of (Non to related) traffic that would cause the page to pop up. Just a note for the PS: section - there are multiple ways to post reactions to multiple people. Personally i prefer to copy-n-paste the entire section back and forth between pages, since that assures that the conversation is always up to date and readable for everyone (Whereas only placing responses on other people's talk pages would lead to a fragmented conversation.

 Other editors prefer other methods - some just post a reply on every involved parties talk page. Alternatively you can place the Talkback template on another users page to notify them that you left a response for them on your own page (Which is convenient in its own rights, since you can keep the entire conversation on a single page). All methods are really fine - in the end it is just a means to make sure that another editor managed to find your reply. )  (Contact me,Contribs) """

 Possible issue 
One weird question. The old rumor about the last line of EoE came out as true, and in a rather disturbing interview. The line was supposed to be """"I'd never want to be killed by you of all men, absolutely not!"""" but was changed to """"Disgusting"""" after a question from Anno. The situation as commented by Miyamura (voice of Asuka) is: 
At last Anno asked me, """"Miyamura, just imagine you are sleeping in your bed and a stranger sneaks into your room. He can rape you anytime as you are asleep but he doesn't. Instead, he masturbates looking at you, when you wake up and know what he did to you. What do you think you would say?"""" I had been thinking he was a strange man, but at that moment I felt disgusting. So I told him that I thought """"Disgusting"""". And then he sighed and said """"... thought as much."""" He said. """" I thought as much. Original text mirror, archived 
Now here's the situation. This actually is a very simple analysis - one which I am sure even Wikipedia would allow, but it is of a bit questionable nature. In End of Evangelion, Shinji sees Asuka in the hospital, ends up revealing her body and masturbates to her. Asuka who returns after the Third Impact (questionable prior death notwithstanding) makes the comment """"Disgusting"""" when she is laying beside Shinji.

 Moving Teras Kasi from """"Movies and Television"""" to """"Games"""" 

 
Though the game Masters of Teräs Käsi is set in the Star Wars universe, the fighting style exists only in video games, namely Masters as well as Star Wars: Galaxies. It has never been mentioned in the movies, and is not part of the canon. I propose that this entry be moved to the games section.

Teras Kasi is also part of several Star Wars novels written by Steve Perry. So it is not just used in games, it is is also used in several of Steve Parry's star wars novels.

JJL, 23 November 2005
Tai Shing Pek Kwar is a real style of monkey kung fu, not (or in addition to?) a fictional one. It's the style of Paulie Zink. Does it belong here?

On Taejutsu, it was not invented by Seth McFarlane for """"Family Guy"""", although he might have thought so at the time. Taejutsu is actually the name of the unarmed fighting style which is part of Ninjutsu. See any book by Stephen K. Hayes.

Thats Taijutsu, different spelling. Also I second the moving the Teras Kasi thing, never been in or near the movies, and I don't believe that it does have any relation or connection to the the Force, the article on it certainly says nothing about that. Lastly is Fuck You not infact a joke Mike Myers said in So I Married An Axe Murderer, not a fictional martial art from that movie?  

 Miss Ho style 

While drunken boxing is real, the drunken Miss Ho style Wong Fei Hong makes up is not.

Miss Ho is one of the eight drunken immortals of legend, and her movements are part of the Eight Immortals Style, as well as other forms of Drunken Boxing.

Also, wouldn't lightsaber fighting be broken up into the dark side and the light side?
 In fact, it is mentioned in canon resources that there are seven traditional lightsaber fighting styles (or, they are mentioned up through seven), though their exploration is done entirely in non-canon. 

 Naruto 

What about adding the martial arts from Naruto? Tekken Taijutsu (with its swirling leaf attacks and inner gate openings), Jyuken Taijutsu with its Dim Mak-ness, etc.

 CQC 

I've seen references and articles that state that CQC is a real combat system and the MSG3 CQC style is simply a version with a alternative history and modified for gameplay. Not really a fictional MA. Someone should check this out. 

I believe CQC is real only because I saw it on many websites describing it's origin (all are the same), The history channel, and...wikipedia >_> I'll just go ahead and remove CQC from the list. 

""""CQC"""" is an acronym for """"Close Quarters Combat"""". It's just a generic term for armed and unarmed close combat tactics, not a specific art, although there are several military and paramilitary organizations that use it to refer to their hand-to-hand training systems. On the other hand, the thing featured in MGS3 is a specific fictional art, albeit inspired by real-life tactics...

I find this information very important and interesting observation and it is a substantial overstatement that Obama's health is fine and somehow ununique. Everybody's body has had a unique past and is unique at the present state and a result of how someone treats their body. The truth is that there is no such thing as normal especially given substantial genetic differences and the vast differences in lifestyle including diet, activity levels, and drug use, etc. Scjessey, do you have a source that claims that Obama's health is , in your words, """"perfectly normal and unexceptional"""" And tell me the date of publication? I think I have a very good point given that researchers have decided that this topic is important enough to do large scale academic research on this topic. That in and of it self deserves at least a one sentence mention, perhaps not even in this article. Media outlets have reported this. Is there a wikipedia wide consensus that somehow a media coverage is not notable solely because it is, in your words """"as a matter of routine"""" or is that your point at all?

Hello, thank you very much.  Yes unfortunately someone decided to go ahead and delete the page before anybody could mediate.  After 10 days the discussion was still very much active and no warning was given of deletion, or consideration of the fact that I requested mediation to resolve serious questions pertaining to bias and bad-faith.  Also, during deletion review I have shown that it is doubtful that the closing admin even read the AFD arguments properly and probably wasn't even aware that mediation had been requested.  This admin says there was clear consensus but the fact is that it was claerly shown during AFD that the advocates for deletion could not motivate their own statements, instead chosing to default anyway with """"Delete"""" endorsements.  I am told that the onus of proof lies on me yet I have addressed every single criticism repeatedly whereas they could not and did not submit proof for their own statements.  Also there were many supporters who presented arguments for 'keep' (probably outweighing the number who wanted 'delete') but these arguments were never addressed and the guys at deletion review are telling me that these contributions have zero weight because the people who want to 'keep' are all first-time users.  Deletion review is also proving unhelpful and in my opinion also biased with nobody seriously considering the arguments that have been raised, or really prepared to read through the AFD discussion properly.  I have no idea of what to do next and in fact if anything can be done.  I am extremely disillusioned with this process as it is obvious that prejudgements and lots of Wiki-speak are employed to 'prove' unsuitability, rather than arguments being actually objectively considered.

 Comment on Seregain 

Actually, I was never almost blocked for my behavior. If you'll read the past AN/I incident, a user (Coldplay Expert) proposed a malformed """"topic ban"""" after the issue had already been resolved (which Jclemens corrected him on). He apologized afterwards

In the past AFD, I addressed each of Seregain's allegations individually and proved that most of them were lies or misunderstandings, and also provided a series of links which show that he is a likely banned editor come back under a new screenname for the purpose of pushing an evangelical Christian POV (he has only 200 edits, his 1st of which was a well-formed AFD for Secular Student Alliance, and this is just the tip of the iceberg).

Since Jclemens ended the dispute, Seregain's edits were never reviewed, but I'll be happy to bring them back up again. As for """"wikistalking"""", Seregain linked to an offsite forum profile which he believed to be me and complained on Wikipedia for something said offline (personally I think he deserves an immediate ban for trying to """"out"""" me on other sites, but I'll let the admins handle it).

 biography of Lazar Kaganovich 

a Nice read from a fascinating book for those who deny Kaganovich is one of the worst mass murderers in history and edit it my post defending him. Maybe some information can be added to the page?

Lazar Kaganovich, one of the bloodiest of the communist butchers during the 1930s and 1940s and the number-two man in the Kremlin for many years. 

The book is The Wolf of the Kremlin, and it was written by Stuart Kahan, an American Jew who is Kaganovich's nephew. Kahan went to the Soviet Union in 1981 and interviewed his uncle extensively  in Yiddish  to write this biography, and it is a goldmine of revelations.

To sum it up, Lazar Kaganovich was a Jew raised in the Jewish tradition, a yeshiva boy taught to guide himself on the basis of doing always what is best for the Jews, and this precept actually is cited explicitly several times in the book. He attended his first Communist Party meeting in 1911, when he was 18, to hear the Jewish communist Trotsky give a speech in a synagogue in Kiev; that's right: in a synagogue. He rose rapidly in the inner circle of the Communist Party. His success was due primarily to his aggressiveness and his ruthlessness. In his communist activity he held back from nothing, no matter how brutal or bloody. He even killed his fellow Jews when they got in his way. He was a gangster among gangsters.

In 1930 Kaganovich organized a special department of the Soviet secret police, with himself as the head. It was referred to as the department of """"wet affairs,"""" with """"wet"""" meaning """"bloody."""" That is, it handled clandestine mass executions, of the sort carried out later at Vinnitsa in Ukraine and at Katyn in Russia and at a thousand other places throughout the Soviet Union over the next two decades. Kaganovich became the commissar in charge of mass murder. Yet when the German Army invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, it was Kaganovich who was the savior of the Jews: he arranged for the evacuation of all Jews from the frontier areas and their resettlement far to the east, where they would be safe from the Germans. Let the Ukrainians and the Russians bear the brunt of the German invasion, but protect the Jews from hardship and danger at any cost.

When the Gentile communist Nikita Khruschev accused Kaganovich in 1957 at a Soviet Party Congress of having murdered 20 million Russians during his career, Kaganovich didn't even deny it. He only accused Khruschev of being a murderer too. """"Your hands are blood-stained too,"""" Kaganovich told him. Khruschev pointed out that the difference was that he, Khruschev, had merely followed Kaganovich's orders, while it had been Kaganovich who had formulated the policies of mass murder and had given the orders for carrying out those policies.

As I said, it's a fascinating book, this biography of Lazar Kaganovich, and if you really want to gain some insight into his mentality, you should read it for yourself. 

Kaganovich wants to boast about the power he once held, and at the same time he wants to evade responsibility for his crimes, and one can see this ambivalent attitude throughout the book.

Yours,

What do you call everything you do FeloniousMonk? That is, if it's not a political campaign on your part, what is? The POV campaigning I see here is a radical left-wing campaign on your part. My only goal is to bring things into balance here on Wikipedia because most outsiders regard it as highly unreliable and biased. Why don't readers have the right to know the type of group CRESP is ideologically speaking and who they associate with?

What's the problem with showing the political biases of groups you support, say compared with your baseless accusation that people like Paul Weyrich or James Dobson want to impose Old Testament law upon the United States? I thought that if something was factual and verifiable, it was kosher. That's what you told me about TheocracyWatch. If Paul's a theocrat, then maybe you could find a first-hand reference of the kind I provided. Are you not aware that United for Peace and Justice was founded by the Communist Party USA and a number of Marxist groups, and according  to the Commmunist Party USA Web site Joelle Fishman an officer of the CPUSA is a member of the steering committee? Tell me, why are you so worried about people knowing that CRESP belongs to an organization populated by the Ruckus Society, CodePink and the Communist Party USA?
The vast majority of the UNFPJ's members are pretty extreme on the Left side of the spectrum. The important thing about UNFPJ is who founded it.
For me to a belong to a group on the right akin to the UNFPJ, it would be akin to belonging to a group founded or run by the Nazis. Are you afraid of the truth?

Deal with the substance here, not my personality, or your efforts to railroad me with a phony RfC signed by your friends. Let's stop applying the rules differently when they make you uncomfortable. 

Why is it poisoning the well to point out the fact CRESP is involved with a pretty radical group? Are you afraid of the truth? NPOV doesn't mean just FeloniousMonk's point of view. I'm for balance, and diversity of opinions, expressed fairly is a good idea, don't you think?

TheocracyWatch can't prove it's claims, but I can prove these.
 
There's nothing for me to learn from the RfC except some people are afraid of having their worldviews challenged, or from being restrained from pressing their anti-religious political agendas. If you don't like my """"POV campaigning,"""" then why do you do it yourself? 

What do you call your series of hit pieces on the Christian Right about the supposed threat of """"Dominionism,"""" if it's not POV campaigning? Why is it every article you have posted on politics or religion expresses a Left of center POV? If I missed one, show me. I guess that's not POV campaigning, right?

Just in case you hadn't noticed, 49 of the 50 states say God is the ultimate authority, and it's spelled out in their constitutions.

How is expressing a more neutral perspective that is closer to the center of the political spectrum a threat to Wikipedia? What makes your POV superior to mine?  """

{{unblock|
 Note: This is a complex request, which needs a reasonable amount of review, its not a quickie, and I request a review by an admin that has the time.  Thank you.
This is a highly improper blocking by Jehochman, which is abusive and overkill which clearly demonstrates Jehochman's interested take on my editorship, which by Wiki guidelines should mean that this is handed off to an uninterested admin, without blocking.  This block should be reversed if for nothing else to allow me to respond.  This stems from myself asking an admin why I was blocked, a block which was overturned on its merits.  I was asking the blocking admin, what my actions where that caused the blocking.  Gwen Gale never asserted that she was being uncomfortable, that she took this as anything except related to her admin function, and never even hinted she felt harassed in any way.  Further my interactions with her were above board, polite, and on topic.  Jehochman indefinite block is uncalled for, and should be rescinded, either by himself doing the right thing, or by review on merits
Further details:
1.  Toddst1 is a common associate with Gwen Gale, whom was an interested party in reviewing her blocking of me.  That block was reviewed by an uninterested admin who rejected the block.   Toddst1 was the first to suggest there was a problem with my interactions with Gwen Gale in asking for clarification.  My question on the block, related in part to his review of the block, making him very interested in my questions of the merits of the block.   Toddst1 should have never been the review for a Gwen Gale 
2. Jehochman is an interested admin with whom I have had interactions with on this topic, and with Gwen Gale at the same time.   This history is ample bias, and goes far in explaining the overkill usage of an indefinite ban.
3. Jehochman without acknowledge our history, assesses my editing as not productive.  My edits remain in place in live articles, and my contributions are needless dismissed.  Allowing an indefinite ban to be support by these charges by an interested admin, are wholly unfair.
4. Jehochman asserting he can not reference in any manner what are the causes of why my edits have been a BLP violation is a complete farce.  This is the exact issue which occurred the last time, and for which I was never given any explanation.  LETS BE CLEAR, any concerns or issues can be raised in a manner that does not cause a furthering of a BLP issue.  Making generalized statements is not a stretch, and there is no reason why they should not be offered, as explanation to what is going on.  It is my asking for explanation which is at the center.  How can meritorious request for explanation become the object for a indefinite ban???
5. Jehochman breaks protocol and request that other admins communicate with him, via email.  There is no reason why Jeochman action as admin should not be done via the normal Wiki process of openness.
6. Jehochman is an associate of Dave1185.  Dave1185 is who Jehochman seems to be referring to as warning me.  Dave1185 fashions himself as some sort of vigilante.  He began by entering items on my talk page, then asserting I was harassing, then writing on Gwen Gales page that I was harassing, then bragging to Gwen Gale that I was indefinitely blocked.  After I was block Dave1185 returns to my Talk page, deletes content, and puts his Vigilante signature on it.  you bag'em, we tag'em~!  I am being gamed by Dave1185, and its improper to give an indefinite block based upon this kind of chicanery.   Dave1185 changing of my TALK page after instigating a block on me, is some sort of victory dance, that is clearly improper.
Summary: The indefinite block of me for reasonably asking the original block admin for the reasons why I was blocked is improper and uncalled for.  Gwen Gale is capable of speaking for herself and doing it direct to me.  Toddst1 is an interested admin who's actions were rejected by an uninterested admin.  Jehochman and I have a history, and his blocking of me, based on the urgings of Dave1185 of me is not proper.  The usage of an indefinite ban is clear overkill, and demonstrates Jehochman's prior involvement where this matter should have been handed off to another admin to review and for an uninterested admin to take or not take any action.

I request this indefinite ban be lifted, for the merits above.  Asking an admin whose block was overturned, for information as to what caused the original block....should not be CAUSE for an indefinite block.  That is what has happened.

0,"Two points 

Nobody asked my opinion, but I'd like to mention two points that might be of use. A Rwandan academic I once knew told us that in his country, female circumcision consisted in exposing the clitoris by incising the clitoral prepuce to make it more accessible for hygiene AND for masturbation. Nowhere in the main article and its classifications of FMG types to I find any reference to that. The practice is combined in Type I along with removal of the clitoris.

My second point is that the notion that women are often stronger proponents of FGM than men seems to me to be a dangerous one, because it seems to me that it misses an essential point: that in patriarchal societies, women often, and even systematically, collaborate with the male-dominated power structure.

A third point, at no extra charge: Male circumcision is definitely mutilation, especially if incision of the clitoral prepuce alone is."

As WP:OI says,
Original images created by a Wikipedian are not considered original research, so long as they do not illustrate or introduce unpublished ideas or arguments, the core reason behind the NOR policy.
The published information which is the basis for the annotation (i.e. the three letters/arrows) is explained on the image description page for the uncropped map  and also in a footnote to the map's caption  i.e.
Macmillan gives the steps in setting a blast, the location and circumstances of the accident, and the location of Gage's lodgings and Harlow's home and surgery..
Thoughts on this? As with the image links, I've put the map back so we (and others) can see what we're talking about.   

A9 Proving a negative
This regards a recent edit  to the passage 
Macmillan's comprehensive survey of accounts of Gage (scientific and popular) found that they almost always distort and exaggerate his behavioral changes...
which removed the word comprehensive.

This is a delicate point and I want to come up with something everyone can live with. I think there are two questions here.

First, Was Macmillan's analysis indeed comprehensive? No one who's been participating have any doubt on that, but just in case, open the collapse list.

""""first rate example of carefully done historical work"""" (Psychological Reports, 2001)
""""obstinately searched all possible sources. It seems very unlikely that anyone else could find a relevant piece not considered (Cortex, 2004)
""""fastidious archaeological removal of the layers of legend"""" (Lancet, 2001)
""""Even some of the most prestigious academic researchers have disseminated erroneous information..."""" (Neurosurgery Quarterly, 2002)
""""The definitive account. One of those rare occasions on which one can truly say that further research is not necessary."""" (Science, 2000)
""""Macmillan scoured all the sources and commentaries on the case and as far as material regarding Gage is concerned this must be a definitive work.  (History of the Human Sciences, 2007)
""""Macmillan has shown that the record of how Phineas Gage’s character changed after the accident must be considered with caution..."""" (New England Journal of Medicine"""", 2004)

Second, Do we need to say the analysis was comprehensive? IMO I think we do, because it the analysis assserts a negative, which requires extraordinary research; just saying Macmillan found no mention omits that such extraordinary research was in fact done. (Two examples from the collapse box: """"Macmillan has obstinately searched all possible sources. It seems very unlikely that anyone else could find a relevant piece not considered""""; """"The definitive account. One of those rare occasions on which one can truly say that further research is not necessary."""")Without such a clear statement, we get edit summaries such as this one: .

Actually, there's a third question: Do we need to include a quotation (such as the """"further research is not necessary""""  above) supporting the comprehensiveness? I don't think the reader needs that. I had put it in a footnote to the article recently only because another editor had questioned the comprehensiveness  in other words, the quotation was there for editors, not readers, and this discussion can take its place.

So what I suggest is that the article say Macmillan's comprehensive analysis of accounts of Gage...'', where [97][98][99] cite to a few of the sources supporting the comprehensiveness, but without quoting them. What do you think?

You have to decide if you are on the side of truth and life that I intended for this technology to bring or allow those lord high felons to destroy me with unfair and unequally applied rules. Are you going to be a part of that? Why do I say this? Because if I don't stand no honest person will forever thereafter. Have Wikipedia editors blocked William R.

No. Or punished those dealing out blocks to me when they knew I did nothing for political bias? Did Wikipedia give me credit for my work and ban the copyright infringer and ultimate dark and threatening talker Freitas and Merkle  from this place NO! 

Wikipedia's rules clearly allow the publishing of lies from longer standing people of note, no mater how nefariously they slam the up and coming and tell lies far and wide and Wikipedia knowingly lets them. This is a media rag, period. Like any other. There are no real rules when they apply differently to one than another. Further, again, if you are being destroyed by unfair rules you have a Boston Tea party. Get it? It's called """"self defense"""" something you clearly do not understand. The only rule is a fair one and I don't see you or any other here trying to keep them fair in any way form of fashion you are just blowing political smoke. If you did we would not be here. I have not once been treated fairly and I don't see you doing it or anyone here that bothers to hang around here. You speak of rules, then block those that wrongly attacked me first before I even had a chance to play fair. Before I stuck my head out of the womb as a newbie around here. Don't walk away when I am being punished wrongly and you know it and above all don't drag my good name through the mud like a pig would do Mr. media guy. If you treat me fairly, you would be the first, from Larry King to Don and Mike to the Chief of police in Prince William County Virginia who had me arrested five times knowing I was innocent saying I was crazy for just talking about a self-replicator, even with my patent in my hand, gold seal and all (and you won't write of that here, not fairly). You want fair rules start making and enforcing them fairly and changing the unfair ones here starting here and now (but you wont). But most of all punish those who start the transgressions, not those fighting to defend themselves from the initial onslaught. And do not tell me you do not have special preferences around here.

I have contacted every lawyer on the list at the patent office and they will not sue a university professor (to answer you that question).

Comment to anyone reading The above distinction is now moot, since it was decided to remove automatic Olympic medal categorization via Template:MedalGold, Template:MedalSilver, and Template:MedalBronze, due to undesirable lack of sort key in those additions.  So now all 3 pairs of """"Medal"""" templates are equivalent  all they do is format the row of the medal table, and nothing else.  So it goes.   Of course, who knows what the Olympic Wiki project people may think up to do retroactively to any page that uses Template:MedalGold etc., so it's still safest to use Template:MedalGoldGeneric for non-Olympic medal tables.   talk 21:51, 31"""

 Clarification on Wikipedia naming standards 

Hi Kohikoi,

You just left a message on my talkpage where you immediately threatened to block me out of the blue instead of a friendly suggestion or attempt to discuss/investigate. I would like to remind you that Wikipedia:Administrator_Code_of_Conduct | Wikipedia admin code of conduct}} guidelines specifically state...

threatening a user with an inappropriate block is just as bad behavior as actually making that block
admins should never use their admin abilities to intimidate others

To deal with your concerns though. From my tandpoint I just corrected a breach of Wikipedia naming standards that appear politically motivated. However,you just suggested the current version of these pages are the result of a long-standing consensus between several users. Do you have evidence of this consensus? (i.e Where exactly is it reported on Wikipedia?) As far as I can tell the page for  naming conventions of Greek and Turkish named places specifically states... 

""""This Wikipedia page is currently inactive and is retained as a historical archive. Either the page is no longer relevant or consensus has become unclear. If you want to revive discussion regarding the subject, you should seek broader input via a forum such as the proposals page of the village pump.""""

Furthermore, I have to ask why is there suddenly a special page only for Greek/Turkish naming conventions in the first place? The standards proposed on that page appear to directly contridict broader Wikipedia naming standards which state...

Use modern English names for titles and in articles. Historical names or names in other languages can be used in the lead if they are frequently used and important enough to be valuable to readers, and should be used in articles with caution.

I'm a a hotheaded newb so perhaps I'm missing something here. Any insight would be appreciated """

Answer to Mütze
Well, I am surprised to see that I am unblocked! At least, you still have seen that you targeted the wrong person for the wrong reasons!!

Mütze, I have used this Wikipedia for only a few days but I am still not an idiot. Of course, what I say further below on what I think you did is an assumption but I believe a very good one! Here is what you did. You saw the following I posted on the Bosendorfer discussion page:
""""Very soon, this article will be published and you will have to leave it this way; otherwise, the censors at Wikipedia will be forced to side with me (!!) considering the fact that I gave you the opportunity to challenge what I wrote in my article."""".

As you clearly told me yourself, you did not want my article to be published. This quote clearly threatened you because I told taht I will soon publish my article and it will be with the full support of everybody because I used the discussion page of Bosendorfer. You then contacted Andrew Norman to block me to prevent me from editing the Bosendorfer discussion page and then you thought you could keep me away on my own user page with the intention of blocking me indefinitively. When you blocked me indefinitively through RobertG, you knew too well that no one could read my user page afterward! That is what I believe you did! And it is probably easily verifiable by people at Wikipedia.

Now, what is your role at Wikipedia? You are not an administrator; otherwise you would have blocked me yourself directly!

Anyway, I propose to carry on the discussion on the Bosendorfer discussion page concerning my article. I am ready to change sentences that cause problems. It is just up to you to mention these problematic sentences on this Bosendorfer discussion page and if you have a valid reason to have this sentence changed, it will be changed. I am not a fanatic and I am ready to please people. I will use logic and reason to assess a request to change sentences, not emotions. If I do not want to change a sentence, I will say clearly why and we could discuss further on this refusal to accept a change if it happens.

And I will answer the points you raised in your previous postings, Mütze.

So, I hope you will behave a little bit more relaxed about what I intend to do. The goal: publish a good article on a good product that inform people who read it. Apparently, for the time being, mostly the group of administrators and their friends (!!) who are the only ones who complained about my article so far.

But to have had to go through such a nightmare just to want to publish a good article on Wikipedia is surely not the right way to do at Wikipedia with people who are ready to contribute positively!! You are really going to put people off wanting to write on Wikipedia! And I especially target the administrators who have been in contact with me in a very aggressive way. Just a few days ago, I did not even know that what an administrator was at Wikipedia!

Here is what Jimbo Wales says on his user page:
""""Newcomers are always to be welcomed. There must be no cabal, there must be no elites, there must be no hierarchy or structure which gets in the way of this openness to newcomers."""".
If he knews what I had to go through and the very aggressive behaviour I experienced from administrators at Wikipedia, he would not be very pleased. What I say above, he call it one of his main principles!

So, administrators, when you contact people, make sure you remember this very core principle of one of the founders of Wikipedia and target the true vandals instead of people like me who are willing to add a good article to Wikipedia!

Jimbo Wales wants people to write as many articles as possible on Wikipedia. Your role as administrators is to help and encourage them to do so instead of trying to block them indefinitively!

So, I hope you can now all relax and not get emotional or upset on this coming article. I follow the process used by Wikipedia to deal with an article that causes opposition. See the new comments now on the Bosendorfer discussion page and state the sentences that cause you problems and especially why these sentences are problematic. Then, I will do my best to change them to please everybody.

Hi Grsz, please check the policy. It isn't edit warring if I make adjustments to find a compromise as I have been doing. Actually, I'm surprised that you and anonymous user 75.31.111.54 find it so outrageous that Wright is a campaign advisor when the news has been reporting on this from the beginning. However, I'm not surprised in the Obama campaign response. After the controversy it would be very uncharacteristic of a political campaign if it didn't try to minimize Wright's role, but it is a role that he, in fact, had with the campaign. Take care!   22:48"

Sloppy and wrong. The newer questions should be placed at the bottom of the page, so I had to move this question from the top. 128.84.159.160 should have read the template header to this page, which says [[Wikipedia:Signatures|Please sign and date your posts by typing four tildes and Put new text under old text.

 Now to the questions.
""""Psychiatric drugs""""?  What this person means is """"mood stabilizers and anti-depressants."""" No, what I mean is """"many psychiatric drugs"""" that is many antidepressants, mood stabilizers and anti-seizure medications as well as most of antipsychotics, anxiolytics and hypnotics. And of course the psychostimulants are excluded.

Second, what should be used in this case NOT COMMONLY ASSOCIATED or DOES NOT CAUSE? The difference is quite clear but, since bupropion is actually used to counteract weight gain and sexual dysfunction, one can quite safely reject such causality.  """

 Waiting period for autoconfirm is too short 
This doesn't directly deal with the pages the info is on, but rather with those who are editing the pages, and looking at the behaviour of the editor.

One of the things that keeps coming up is the sense of how overly easy it is to get autoconfirmed.

I think (and partly based upon an rfc concerning this) that we should change the 4 days/10 edits to 7 days/20 edits.

The """"urge"""" to edit in a way that may be deemed inappropriate (vandalism, etc.) can be cooled at least some.

I've found in dealing with such people, that once a person has to wait past their weekend (whatever days that might be), the urge is often gone and forgotten - typically replaced with other impulsive urges. And many editors have a 5 day school week or work week.

So simply increasing the number of days requirement from 4 to 7 might do wonders, and wouldn't affect those positive editors overly much (especially since admins can now give """"autoconfimed"""" out ahead of time at their discretion.

And this would help directly deal with the question about the usefulness/effectiveness of semi-protection might be on low traffic/watched pages. -  
I think it should be an AND requirement, not an OR.  Make them wait AND contribute in the meantime by editing first.  And ensure the 20 edits (count in mainspace only) aren't reverted or deleted.  Yes it may slow down the new page creation... but is that a problem?  
I agree with the idea of raising the threshold for autoconfirmation. Wikipedia talk:User access levels/RFC on autoconfirmed status required to create an article closed in January this year so you could reraise it, but I think I know what the result would be. Increasing the threshold or making it and not or or only measuring mainspace edits would in my view have a better chance of success. ''SpielChequers'' """

PLease explain to me, sentence by sentence, why you have edited out the following addition:

The main impact zone of the crash was approximately 19 metres (57 feet) in width. No wreckage was found from the airliner within this impact zone or inside the building. The lawn immediately in front of the crash site was unmarked. Within the main impact zone was a hole that the object punched in the building, approximately 9 metres (27 feet) in width. The Pentagon is composed of five concentric rings. Only the outer three rings were penetrated. The upper floors of the first ring collapsed, but the structural integrity of the second and third rings remained. At the end of the third ring was a circular 'punch out' hole, again 9 metres (27 feet) in diameter. The wingspan of a Boeing 757 is 38 metres (114 feet). The vast majority of the mass of the aircraft remains unnaccounted for. For flight 77 to have caused the damage observed at the Pentagon, the wings would have had to have been broken off, pushed into the fuselage, after which the fueselage and wings would have had to have been compressed sufficiently to fit through the 9 metre hole. No physical mechanism by which this process could have occurred is known.

Flight 77 did not hit the pentagon. Its so obvious as to be comical. The capacity of human beings to believe what is demonstrably complete bullshit because they are afraid of going against the group consensus never ceases to amaze me. You are being lied to, day in, day out, by your media. Stop. Think. Please.

I do not make a living off a breeding dogs . But I wish to protect the breed from breed specific legislation. This wrong missleading information posted here does REAL life harm to the breed.

The Russian have created as per more ref a new fighting breed.

Please if you insist on working with this editor while I spend time rescueing all the dogs she forgets in shelters. I cant do all the rescues and stay here fulltime, and care for my farm and dogs. 

So pls i beg youn change the name from CAS to CAO and have her ruin the breed under its russian version name . Allow me to try to save the breed from future bsl.

Well I think, there is just plain bullying going on by the pro-infobox crowd. The present unwritten system which leaves info-boxes to the discretion of the principal content editors is best and 99% of the time it works until a bullying pro-boxer arrives off the street and inserts a box and then fights to keep it.

 Hello.  Thanks.  First, if you want to chat with me, please reply at my Talk Page - not at yours.  I check my Talk Page every day and see the new postings.  I certainly do not check your Talk Page every day to see if you posted anything there.  My Talk Page is at this link here > User talk:Joseph A. Spadaro.  Second, per Wikipedia rules, I am not giving any legal advice at all, just trying to answer a semantics question.  Third, remember that the situation and laws are different all over the place.  I am in the USA and answering as such ... I have no idea where you are located, and if it is within or outside the USA.  So, all of that being said ... I can now answer your latest follow-up questions.  Let me address the first part of your question, which states: """"one is free to terminate such a contract for whatever reasons are permitted or not forbidden within that contract.""""  In a one word answer, yes.  But, the way that your follow-up question is worded, it seems like you are mixing apples and oranges  that is, confusing very different things.  I guess I am not sure what you mean by """"terminating"""" a contract?  The contract itself usually has dates within it, such as """"This contract runs from January 1, 2008, and will expire on December 31, 2008.""""  So, you never """"terminate"""" that contract  it just """"dies"""" on December 31, 2008.  If you want to """"break"""" (""""stop"""") the contract before the ending date of December 31, that's a different story - and it would depend on why (what reasons) you want to not finish out the whole year-contract.  As you refer to, some contracts will have explicit terms within them that delineate when/where/how/why the contract may be terminated.  Some contracts have no dates in them, correct.  And, within them, there will be (there should be) certain reasons as to when / how / why either party may """"end"""" the contract.  But, in a one-word simplistic answer ... yes, one is free to terminate such a contract for whatever reasons are permitted or not forbidden within that contract.  Let me address the second part of your question, which states: """"one cannot legitimately accuse the contractee of 'insubordination' ...""""  Again, you are mixing apples and oranges.  So, it is a hard question to answer.  In a simple answer, the answer is ... maybe yes and maybe no.  If any terms of the contract deal with """"insubordination"""", then - yes, one party may certainly accuse the other party of insubordination.  For example, a contract may state: """"If Party A does not report to the work site prior to 9 AM, that will be considered insubordination"""" ... or """"If Party B does not submit the appropriate paper work at the end of the day, that action will be considered insubordination"""" ... or something like that.  So, if the terms of the contract deal with insubordination, then - yes, one party may certainly accuse the other of insubordination.  Now, let's say that the contract does not in any way mention insubordination.  (This is probably the likely case that you are referring to.)  Then, in terms of semantics (that is, language and wording) ... then, no  one party may not accuse the other of insubordination.  But, really, they can accuse the other party of breaching the terms of the contract ... that is, not meeting up with their end of the bargain in the contract.  So, the real and correct words (semantics) would be that one party accuses the other of either: breaching (breaking) the contract ... or ... not complying with the terms and consitions of the contract ... or words like that.  Those essentially mean the same thing as the concept of insubordination (not doing what you are supposed to do and expected to do, when asked to do so).  But, you just would not use the word insubordination.  You would use the word """"violating our contract"""".  But, in spirit, it all means the same thing.  So, if I was the party to the contract .... and the other party accused me of """"insubordination"""" ... and our contract terms never mention insubordination ... then, I would take that to mean that the other party is accusing me of not adhering to the terms of the contract and he is simply using the wrong jargon ... but he may (or may not) be wrong in principal and substance.  In other words, just because the other party used the wrong/incorrect word (he improperly used the incorrect word of insubordination), that doesn't change the fact that maybe, yes, I did do something wrong and I did go against the contract.  I hope this all helps.  Please reply at my Talk Page.  Maybe if you make your question a little more clearer and detailed, I can craft a better answer.  Thanks.  (  )"""

 Zambo Article  
Hi Peridon,

I notice you've removed the speedy deletion tag I put on the Zambo Article.  As requested, I have provided sources in the discussion page which I will repeat below for your review and consideration:

African Languages and Ebonics by Dr. Katherine Harris, Central Connecticut State University.  Africa Update. Vol. IV, no. 3 (Summer 1997) Pan-African Language Patterns Revisited:  

""""The erosion of African names also occurred. Samba, meaning comfort in Wolof, is still recalled in musical form in Brazil, where there remains a strong African presence. A possible derivation of Samba is Zambo (Southern/Central Africa), which also means to give comfort. Other derivatives are Sambu in Mandinka and Sambo in Hausa. The fact that the name was at one time fairly common and no longer used may have relationship to a song popularized by white Americans during the war from 1861-1865, """"Sambo's Right To Be Kilt,"""" and especially the derogatory usage of the name enshrined in the book Little Black Sambo.""""

""""Neutrality requires that each article or other page in the mainspace fairly represents all significant viewpoints that have been published by reliable sources, in proportion to the prominence of each viewpoint in the published, reliable sources.[3]"""" This is what you have quoted me? Unfortunately that is not helpful. I appreciate your attempts but my point that is falling on deaf ears here is this is not a matter of personal opinion. My frustration is only with individuals who believe this is a view point. I have clearly laid out why this is not a POV piece, and still not a single user has proven otherwise, assuming it is a view point simply because it is too long? Is that really a legitimate argument or is Rjensen simply offended that I have challenged the careless lack of regard for scientific knowledge.

""""Giving due weight and avoiding giving undue weight means that articles should not give minority views as much of, or as detailed, a description as more widely held view"""" -
I am sorry you think I am in the minority. Is the same conclusion reached by the World Health Organization, AAP, CPS, Dermatology Associations worldwide, and anyone who has actually OBJECTIVELY reviewed the literature and the tactics used by the industry. For people to say that I am in the minority, perhaps in the court of public opinion, but isn't that how propaganda works? There is not even a shred of doubt based on scientific facts that what is transpiring is propaganda, this is not even open for debate.

Does anyone honestly believe that such a world class underground full contact tournament could have gone on, and there would remain no evidence of it beside Dux's testimony? Anyone who could produce evidence of such a thing would have a million dollar story, but no one has. Wouldn't someone eventually come forward, or one or two fighters maybe speak out against it? What about the families of the fighters? Wouldn't they notice that their loved ones come home with broken bones and missing teeth? Dux himself claims that there were fatalities. In that case wouldn't the families of the dead fighters investigate what happened? Dux further claims that there were spectators gambling in the event (as in the movie), then how could they keep the silence of the spectators for all these years? To this day there remains no video, or pictures or anything to substantiate Dux's claims.

Dux further claims that he holds the record for the fastest """"kick with a knockout"""" at 72 mph. This makes no sense whatsoever. Is there a cop with a radar gun next to ring, measuring the speed of every strike? A 72 mph kick seems impossible, as swords don't even swing that fast. Someone wouldn't just """"jump into"""" such an event either, but they would have training partners, and a record of their fighting career. They would have won tournaments, and fought in other full-contact venues (like ones that actually exist), yet their is no footage or evidence of Dux's participation in such events. He is a martial artist, but nothing like he claims.

The only thing that's been knocked out here is Dux's credibility. Soldier of Fortune magazine exposed his lies about his military career. Using the Freedom of information act they showed that the actual years of his service in the military don't match up with his claims. He could have never served in Vietnam, and was never a special op like he claims. They exposed a picture of him in the military as a hoax, by showing that the ribbons and medals on his uniform are inconsistent with his branch of service. His own response to this is that the uniform was a costume that he was wearing on the way to a halloween party. You gotta be kidding me. Dux sued them for libel and lost.

He also sued Jean Claude Van Damme, saying that he (Dux) had come up with the story for the movie """"The Quest"""", and that Van Damme had made a contract with him for royalties that were never paid. Dux failed to produce any evidence of such a contract, and claimed that the missing evidence was destroyed in an earthquake. Van Damme's lawyer ripped Dux's credibility to shreds, showing that Dux's apartment was not damaged like he said it was, and produced a cast of witnesses to support that Dux is a story teller and pathological liar.

In his book, Dux goes on to make other astounding claims about being a real life James Bond character working for the CIA during the 80's, and many more fantastic tales. The publisher (Harper Collins) pulled the book, and not due to poor sales either. Maybe because they realized they had been duped by this guy, just like the producers of the movie Bloodsport. Just goes to show how little credibility Hollywood has, even when they make the claim that something is based on a true story. 71.233.140.67 (talk) 

    * First, let me say I agree with you. I want to make that clear, because you're not going to like the answer I have to give you. Read WP:TRUTH and one of the first things you will see is: """"Truth is not the criteria for inclusion of any idea or statement in a Wikipedia article, even if it is on a scientific topic. The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth—that is, whether readers are able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, not whether we think it is true."""" I don't like that. You probably won't either, but that is the state of affairs. Those excellent questions you asked? Those are considered original research WP:OR. If someone else asks them in a reliable source, then we can add that to this article. But until they do, we can't. Although we can all edit here, we don't own Wikipedia. So when Dux disagrees with something and decides to sue, he doesn't come after Niteshift36 (although he might try), he comes after Wikipedia. The standard for biographies of living people WP:BLP is even higher than for articles about the deceased or other topics. I can't, for example say that Mr. John Doe is a lying a-hole on Wikipedia if he is still alive. I can't even say it on a talk page or my own user page. But if a writer in Time magazine does an interview where his former boss calls Doe a lying a-hole, we can possibly include that. There are a lot of people who have asked the questions you did. I"

It's upsetting for me to see that someone can falsify and deny the existence of true Turkish novelist F. Rifat Ulkuman just for not to get punished because of the vandalism. I really wonder if you did a complete research about him before deleting his article but just because some random person claims that he doesn't exist, shouldn't give you a right to delete the article of such a big novelist and politician. Labeling the life and publications of such a person as 'Hoax' is a serious claim which needs to be supported by a great research and some and as i can see you haven't done that ,did you? Even though doing that research should be your job let me help you to realize what a serious mistake you have done.

 Irredentist edits in Wikipedia pages 

I found several innovations and new WIKI rules applied by some users, that violates the normal comportament of editors. 
These estonishing edits were made by some editors who managed to block all oponents using gang tactics and misinformation of administrators.

See next page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Origin_of_the_Romanians&action;=history

(→‎Theories on the Romanians' ethnogenesis: unrelevant information (and the two specialist mentioned in connection with the immigrationist theory are not Hungarians - and more non-Hungarian scholar could be added))

All these edits show the real character of the editor named Borsoka. He is considered as an irredentist editor by Romanians, Ukrainian and Serb editors.

Amazing reasons to erase Romanian references and Romanian historians text:
1. Book before WW 2   !
2. Non English reference    !
3. Scholar's view  and not scholar's argumentation (here original research of Borsoka)
4. There is no need to add scholars' POV of their opponents (but in his Hungarian history pages there are a lot of such opinions)
5. Stupid approach   (new original research of Borsoka about Romanian references)
6. Specialists are not Hungarians !

Also the user Fakirbakir erased several Romanian references because he considered 
that he personally disagree the opinions of the Romanian author and if he disagrees an author (here about Georgescu, a historian) he erases it from WIKI pages:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Origin_of_the_Romanians  (section Georgescu's statement)
""""I have to disagree with Georgescu's statement"""".

There is a simple explanation of these amazing innovations and new Wikipedia rules:
The two editors Borsoka and Fakirbakir act as a gang against editors from neighboring countries and act alternatively to avoid the 3RR rule and to eliminate
single editors. Their scope: to emphasize the priority in history of Hungarians; this is a part of the definition of IRREDENTISM: to show the priority in history, against neigbouring countries.

All these reasons made the mentioned history article to be of very bad quality due to irredentist edits. Some Romanian journals wrote about these activities in the Wikipedia pages and so Wikipedia is considered as an unreliable source for history due to these amazing edits. Unfortunately no administrator acted against these tactics.
I mentioned you the vandalism in the mentioned pages but no result.

Conversational tetrachromacy being rare is probably supported by the absence of any support from almost any business, especially businesses with customers who are almost all women and which depend on color perception for customer satisfaction, since most would be happy to expand their sales by 2% by carrying products for tetrachromats and staffing with a tetrachromat and advertising it, but they don't, so the incidence of conversational tetrachromacy among adults and adolescents is likely extremely rare."

0,"Hi Eric, no. You are not in any way one of the people I was talking about. You just got caught in the crossfire, and if I made you think I was thinking of you I apologise. Your work is consistent good plus even more importantly, you have a sensitivity to other people's work with a few people don't. You build on their work to produce something that improves in quality. The people I was talking about arrive at an article, chop it around, change meanings, change context, spelling, capitalisation and then move on, more often than not without giving the slightest suggestion that they actually knew what they were doing. 

For example, one guy when he comes across the word taoisigh which is the gaelic plural for taoiseach and which is explained as such on its first mention in some articles, frequently changes it to taoiseachs, a non-existent word. He has tried to change governors-general to governor-generals, Prime Minister to Prime minister. He changed links from President of Ireland to President of Ireland, links to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (ie the form of UK between 1901 and 1922) to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, so linking the reference to the wrong UK. He mucked up some links to Tánaiste (deputy Irish prime minister) by lower-casing it, changed a series of mentions of First Lady when referring to a specific first lady to lowercase first lady, changed one mention of Garret FitzGerald to Garrett Fitzgerald, removed the word Óg from Gearóid Og Fitzgerald and Mór from Gearóid Mór Fitzgerald, not grasping that they actually were two different people (Mór = big in gaelic and indicated the father, Óg meaning small meant his son) and ended up turning an article that mentioned them both into gobbledigook. That is just some of my work he has mucked up. He made a complete mess of some biology articles, reduced an article on mediæval history to such a degree of unreadability that the author, one of the world's top mediæval historians, quick wiki in disgust. I know at least six people who have left wiki over his actions. And there are quite a few such people. Not a lot, but enough to mangle everything they touch. Another contributor constantly changed an elementary fact in 18th century history on the basis of google searches. I checked on google. The majority of articles said he was right. Those google searches turned up stuff that were barely of high school standard. But she treated google as sacrosanct. If a google search said it, it was gospel. 

I have had political science articles which I have written and which were based on hard fact, in mediocre garbage, applying wrong capitalisation (again based on google searches that largely threw up high school essays), wrong spelling, wrong interpretation, etc. I wasn't reacting simply to the Droop Quota at all (that was the sixth article that day I had done that had been 'hit'. In that case Michael Hardy as he is prone to do, swept in to a topic he knows little about, changed capitalisation, text and even the formula which is the standard DQ formula taught (in that form because as already happened in the discussion on the talk page, if you leave out the parentheses people muck up the order of the calculation and so get the wrong formula). That intervention was classic Michael; go onto a page about a topic he doesn't know much about and instead of asking why it is written like that, unilaterally change it, in most cases producing a version that is so wrong it would be savaged if any student repeated it in a class.

American english and British English use different approaches to capitalisation. Many of the references were to things only found outside the US and so capitalised. Instead he insisted on applying US capitalisation rules to things whose capitalisation is a result of their existence and usage in parts of the world outside the US. That indeed is one of the reasons why google should never be used in checking capitalisation. Apart from its general unreliability, most website mentions in the US are created by people who automatically and incorrectly apply US capitalisation to things that don't exist in the US and are capitalised internationally. A classic example is the electoral system PR.STV (Proportional Representation using the Single Transferable Vote). Michael insisted on lowercasing it on the basis on a google search. PR.STV isn't used in the US and is generally capitalised when referring to the specific voting system, and lowercased when used generically. Where it is mentioned on google, it is largely on the basis of Americans writing about it and downcasing it to suit American english. So Michael unilaterally mucked up the capitalisation, then another US user moved the page to another name that refers to a somewhat similar but not the same electoral system more widely known in the US. So any non-American user would get r"

0,"""::I am surprised you dispute whether or not the Analects contain music criticism when this is so widely written about. Your criticism of Steben’s 2010 paper, “The Philosophy of Music and Ritual in Pre-Han Confucian Thought” http://www.academia.edu/1929545/The_Philosophy_of_Music_and_Ritual_in_Pre-Han_Confucian_Thought_Exalting_the_Power_of_Music_in_Human_Life) for not using the word “criticism” is as unsupportable as your insistence on the word “theory.” Lest we devolve into absurd arguments about the definition of “criticism,” In general, the word is defined as “The action of criticizing, or passing judgment on the qualities or merits of anything….” (The Philological Society, ed. The Oxford English Dictionary, Vol II C, Oxford at the Clarendon Press, 1970, p.1181). With regard to music specifically, “The Oxford Companion to Music” defines it, in specific regard to music, as: “…the intellectual activity of formulating judgments on the value and degree of excellence of individual works of music, or whole groups or genres.”(Latham, ed. Oxford University Press, 2002, p.324) Steben’s paper then clearly describes Confucius’ criticism. As another example, WP’s article on Yayue refers to Confucius’ writing: “The term yayue itself first appeared in the Analects,[2][3] where yayue was considered by Confucius to be the kind of music that is good and beneficial, in contrast to the popular music originated from the state of Zheng which he judged to be decadent and corrupting.[4][5] Yayue is therefore regarded in the Confucian system as the proper form of music that is refined, improving, and essential for self-cultivation, and one that can symbolize good and stable governance.[6][7] “ The Analects contain music criticism whether the word “criticism” appears or not. I think you may be the only person around who thinks otherwise. In the future, if you make assertions like, “You claim that """"Confucius' Analects is, in regard to music, criticism""""; but the reference that you quote in support of your claim utterly fails to actually support it, because it merely never speaks of criticism,” please cite a reference to support your argument. Your continuing argument that a thing cannot be accepted as theoretical unless it specifically uses the word “theory” is similarly problematic because it is not supported anywhere that I can find. Throughout or discussion, I’ve pointed you to references that contradict your personal opinion. If you have a reference for your opinion, please cite. Jacques Bailhé

Support for unblock request

Please follow the """"previous"""" and """"next"""" edits in the above link to """"Diffs."""" just provided. The block, even the reason given for it, just illustrates (in my view) additional piling on of already-unwarranted accusations.
Shell points out the unfair nature of this block: see """"Diffs."""" linked above (move through to """"previous"""" and """"next""""; all of the material has been deleted from Gnan/garra's current talk page.
Why is the administrator not following the same requirements re: """"archiving"""" of current discussions that s/he thinks was required of me by User:John Carter (though JC says it was not).  There was no """"condition"""" or """"requirement"""" in the closing administrator (JC)'s closing summary/conclusion.  I voluntarily added the archiving bot (which is or was malfunctioning apparently, as I have alerted both Shell and Gnan/garra.
My reasonable and logical presentation of my own perspective on the AN/I was posted before not after the """"request"""" by Gnan/garrait had  in it and was edited out in the past day but I put it back in so Shell and Gnan/garra could refer to it more easily.
Labeling my comments as a """"rant"""" or a """"screed"""" is likewise still unwarranted and even (in my view) a violation of Wikipedia:Etiquette, as I have said in the Sept. 5 now-archived AN/I.
Shell has already indicated that this block should be removed (unblocked) and why she thinks so.
My list of comments above was posted prior to Gnan/Garra's archive 25 post (which is misplaced and which I myself restored in #request above; see the date/time stamps.
I did not make (and do not make) any personal attacks (""""PA"""") against anyone and I have not """"reiterated"""" any such """"PA""""; the word """"inhumane"""" is not my word; that is Gnan/garra's word (paraphrase), after quoting me from a now-archived AN/I also out of context.
Again: please provide """"diffs.""""  Paraphrasing and using words like """"inhumane"""" which I myself did not use does not substantiate any claim of my engaging in any such """"PA"""" (personal attack).  I did not engage in any such thing.
I did not """"accuse"""" anyone of anything and certainly did not use uncivil or offensive language, though others did so in that AN/I (see the editing summary, which contains improper expletive language by another user); I said that a user repeatedly seems to lack humane compassion and linked to (earlier version of) my current """"N.B."""" (scroll up); I observed that earlier in the July 2008 AN/I, and still feel that way.  I am being attacked, while I have not attacked anyone (the policy is WP:NPA.  There was no claim of """"personal attacks"""" leveled at me in what Orderinchaos filed on September 5, 2008; all his/her claims have been proved to be incorrect and false.
I have engaged in no blockable """"behavior"""" from July 15 until now; and I still question the block initiated in July; nevertheless, I accepted the terms of that block and immediately accepted an offer of adoption.
I was not the one who """"canceled"""" the adoption by Ecoleetage.  The adopter (Ecoleetage) canceled it on his own after seeing what he says he considered no reason to continue it.
I thought he had or would have contacted User:John Carter to inform him of that, but, apparently, he did not.  That was Ecoleetage's action, not mine.
There was no """"collusion"""" with Ecoleetage on either my part or his part, as Orderinchaos mistakenly claims there was (in the Sept. 5 AN/I statements at top of it).(See I wonder above, Shell's response, and my reply to that.
I have not stated that Orderinchaos engaged in anything but possibly-inadvertent misstatements; nonetheless, they are misstatements and false accusations, which led to further misstatements about my alleged """"behavior"""" from July 15 to September 5, 2008.

And there is no logic to only including issues in this one that only affected the whole games, unless the goal is to make it impossible for readers to find information. Why should someone who wants to know basic information like athletes being sent home from a games, be forced to read 200 odd articles to get a proper understanding of the information?"
0,"Damiano photo 

Hi William Chase, I don't think it's appropriate or necessary to have your name incorporated into the caption (yes, I saw the photo's page), and I think that having it copyrighted and credited to you on that page is sufficient. Fair? It's just too inconsistent with all the other photos on Wikipedia."
0,"In view of what I have written above, I want to report that it takes a little time not just to obtain the studies cited, but to read and process what I read to determine if they fit the section. At first I thought that a mention of the study belonged in the section on occupational stress because burnout played a role in the study. That was a rushed judgment. I changed my mind. I deleted the study by Liljegren and Ekberg although it is a well-done and interesting study. I deleted it because the research conducted did not directly concern occupational stress. The research concerned turnover intentions, turnover itself, and burnout. For example, Liljegren and Ekberg found that burnout was correlated with turnover intentions, and that people who changed their jobs lowered their scores on the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory. Occupational stressors were not measured. Clearly the study could be mentioned in the Wikipedia article on burnout."

0,"Deletion of Malenovski and Kiev school district citations 

Given that this is a contested article, I wanted to explain my reasoning in recent changes.  Firstly,  I inserted exact statistical per centages for the # of schools teaching in Ukrainian.  I did this b/c using partly to characterize 48% and overwhelmingly to characterize 70% is really pushing it.  48% is almost 1/2 and 70 is about 3/4.  Partly sounds like 1/5-2/5 and overwhelmingly is somewhere between 85%-99% broadly understood.

Now about the Kiev's school district footnote.  In my opinion, whereas the information is true, it is too narrow for our purposes here.  Citing national or at least regional statistics seems more appropriate.  As for Malenovski's article, the issue was unverifiability of the statistics.  I read through the article and came to the section where Malenovski cites the numbers (towards the end).  They are there, but no original source is named, no link is given for verification of the numbers.  Finally, I hope that wikipedia editors contributing to Ukrainization will continue to insist on the level of scholarship expected and enforced for sources/articles dealing with the Holodomor article.  Citing Malenovski and going to the lengths of translating his pov (in this case) is rather unacceptable.

By the way, I certainly prefer Gogol in Russian than in translation to English, Polish or Ukrainian.  How can you not love?:

Как упоителен, как роскошен летний день в Малороссии!  Как
томительно  жарки те часы, когда полдень блещет в тишине и зное

The fact that I made my case in an edit summary is utterly irrelevant  there is no policy requiring me to start a superfluous talk page entry as opposed to making the sources known through any other venue or means of discussion on the project.

Your actions in this case, and especially your tone in your edit summaries, seem to suggest that you feel you are in a position to dictate the methodologies of other editors with regard to work flow and communication, but in this case you have no policy argument to support this behaviour and no special position in the community entitling you to interfere in this manner, especially when you had no reason to believe the matter was not already dealt with to the satisfaction of the original parties involved.

This was a discussion based on WP:Verifiability alone, a matter that, until someone tells me otherwise, seems to have been resolved.  If you decide that you have issue with the sources in question, how they should be referenced, or the content itself, fine I urge you to open a talk page discussion on it.  However, if you continue to meddle and revert my content again on no other basis than trying to enforce your preferred procedure, clearly an administrator will have to straighten the matter out."

Dear Philipe, we are a group of 50 editors who have been communicating with each other via the email system. We do not wish to identify ourselves as we do not wish to be associated with drama. This is why we present this anonymously to you. Our intentions are pure and honest and we do not mean to stir up drama. We are gravely concerned regarding the hiring of Oliver Keyes to a position within the Wikimedia Foundation. He has long been known as a very difficult person to work with and he regularly engages in unsolicited attacks. We strongly feel that his hiring by the WMF is a dark stain on the part of the WMF and we strongly urge the WMF to seriously reconsider his appointment. Sincerely, Concerned Editors 134.241.58.253"

The famous 'top and levis' — a neoprene jacket and shrink-to-fit Levis remains one of the best diveskins, offering protection from overexposure to the sun, stings, and abrasion. Levis 501, 505 and 512 Red Tab have a hydrodynamic fit for swimming and diving. Levis have been featured in a variety of under-water commercials: The Mermaid, The Levis Swimmer, The French Dictionary, and numerous beach commercials in the 1990's. Advertised as 'your second skin', Levis are considered by intrepid swimmers and divers to be an extension of their aquatic body, and became popular starting in the 1960's with the famous 'white levis' worn by surfers.      10:40, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)"

Well, 4twenty42o, I certainly don't put on any show here, but if you find it amusing, please have a laugh. Certainly I don't see any fun in it whatsoever. I sure hope that NeilN would take another approach and not jump the gun as he certainly did this time. Also, yes, I am frustrated, and I most certainly have the best reason in the world for that. Mario Roering is not only lying, violating my copyright, slandering, posting defamation etc. here on Wikipedia harming Genseiryu and myself etc. but he does so with dedicated pages in my name on his own homepage and other sites on the Internet. Keeping up with Mario Roering and posting complaints and requests for removal of content on sites such as YouTube, free webhosting etc. is a full time job. Mario Roering has absolutely no just cause for doing what he does, and his involvement here at Wikipedia is no different from his exploiting every other possible way on the Internet to slander me. On the contrary. That is why I do not need anymore crap from anyone, and perhaps I do tend to sort people a little too fast, even though their actions may not have been ill intended, but perhaps the last situation illustrates quite well exactly why I tend to do that? Another good example is when both Mario Roering and I were blocked a few weeks back, Mario Roering was unblocked just an instant later, but I was not, even though we posted the exact same reasons for requesting the unblock. Ever since 2005, when all this started, Mario Roering's candy-talking, deceits and lies have won him favors here on Wikipedia from the admins and others. The last action from NeilN would in my best opinion constitute yet another one such favor. I have never ever postulated, that these favors were done or initiated on purpose, but I have, and I still do claim, that lack of interest for fairness, facts and true intentions, makes this kind of manipulation by Mario Roering possible. And it should not be possible. EVERYONE should be equal to rules and regulations, but for Mario Roering, on mcuh more than one occasion, that has indeed not been the case. Mario Roering has been able to continue his deceitful and ill intended ways on Wikipedia for almost 5 years now. When will it ever stop? As long as it is this easy for Mario Roering to manipulate everyone he wants to, I cannot see the end of it. Even though I still believe that Mario Roering was using NeilN, and that NeilN did indeed jump the gun here siding with one party, instead of issuing equal consequences for both, I will let this one go and """"reset"""" the system. But what I have written here, should be taken into account and something serious should be done about Mario Roering's methods and ways.   """

That seems pretty positive to me. Sorry it's not discussing compounded bioidenticals, but the article makes it clear that it is discussing bioidenticals, as does Boothby when referencing the same data. Compounding does not define bioidentical anywhere but in your mind. Yes, they are associated, but that does not mean that they always go together.

Here's another quote from a NAMS post-graduate course[] - """"BHT is principally a construct within conventional HT that can usually be fulfilled by the use of existing commercial products that are familiar to all practitioners. There are valid reasons for prescribing compounded BHT for an individual patient, including lack of response from conventional manufactured HT, greater dosing flexibility, lack of a commercial equivalent, and especially patient preference.""""

I see that North Korea has been removed from the list twice, on the startling grounds that it is """"no longer communist"""".

Empty Sections
 Should the empty sections in this biography just be removed?   
Not really. If you notice, all of them are linked to articles that focus on every aspect of Pedro II's life: from his birth until his death and even after (Legacy). Right now I am working on them. One (early years) has been raised to GA. Another one (decline and fall) is being reviewed and might become GA. Once all are written and are considered GA I will work on Pedro II's article itself based on those focused articles. Of course if someone else wants to do that on my place, he or she can fell free to to it. Regards,   

National Assembly
The article contains at present 8 references to """"National Assembly"""". No political body existed by that name in the Empire of Brazil. The Brazilian imperial parliament was called """"Assembléia Geral"""" (General Assembly). The General Assembly was a bicameral legislature, comprising the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies (see Political Constitution of the Empire of Brazil, arts. 13 and 14). Accordingly, I propose that references to """"National Assembly"""" should be changed to references the General Assembly. Wikipedia should not invent names for the political institutions of a country189.122.211.125  .

When creating a section in an article's talk page, you should do it at the bottom.
The name """"Assembléia Geral"""" can also be easily translated to National Assembly. There are authors who use """"Regulating Power"""" but also """"Moderating Power"""" in reference to """"Poder Moderador"""" and sometimes is not the best to make a direct translation. The other articles about Brazilian imperial history also use the translation """"National Assembly"""".   

I have found both """"National Assembly"""" and """"General Assembly"""" used in references. """"National Assembly"""" seems to have a long history in 19th century English-language press and other accounts. I assume that """"National Assembly"""" was used to distinguish this assembly from other types of assemblies (i.e., not the national legislature) for the benefit of their English-language audience. I have introduced the Portuguese title for the assembly at the points where it would first be seen by readers. Readers can decide the translation for themselves.   talk 

Speech from the Throne paining
In the painting by Pedro Américo (called Speech from the Throne), the Emperor is portrayed not actually delivering the Speech, but standing, before seating on the Throne to deliver the speech. So I propose that the caption of the painting should not say that the emperor is portrayed """"delivering"""" the Speech, but """"about to deliver"""" it. However, given that prior edits on this point have generated confusion, I will post this proposal here and wait until tomorrow. If there is no objection then I'll make the change. It seems to me that the editor Lecen had finally agreed that the use of """"delivering"""" in the caption did not reflect the reality of the painting, but now another editor (Astynax) has again resorted to the use of that language when making an edit intended to reduce the size of the caption. I agree with Astynax that the mention """"in the opening of the General Assembly"""", can be suppressed, but I submit that to return to the word """"delivering"""" is misleading. 189.122.211.125  

One more time: when you create a section, you must do it at the BOTTOM of the talk page. There is no reason to be so precise about the caption of the image. It is not necessary to have him holding a piece of paper in the picture to have the right to write """"delivering"""". What matter is that he was dressed in regalia due to the Speech of the Throne. That's it. If there is a painting of a boy with a book opened but he is not reading it yet does not mean that we can not write its capiton as """"Boy studying"""". If you do want to help Wikipedia, start writing other articles related to Brazilian imperial history. There are plenty that have few to no info. Also, the wording used on this article and several others related to it - tha are rated Good Articles - on Assembléia Geral is National Assembly. It can not be written """"General Assembly"""" on a caption wh"

Yes, it's a hard one to tackle, and I think you've done a fantastic job given the difficulties involved.  I don't think it's far from A-Class, but I think if you ever want to take it to FAC, it'll need some overhauling.  In particular, you'll have to find some sections to tighten up, and once you've done that I think there are some that could use further expansion.  Personally, I think that the section on equipment should be significantly tightened, leaving some room elsewhere, but I don't really know.  Also, I was about to add it to the ACR, but this is just as good, you're missing one of the conflicts in the immediate aftermath of the war (and as a matter of fact an area where troops were deployed in East Africa during the war), Somaliland.  See 1920 conflict between British forces and Somaliland dervishes and Hastings_Ismay#Somaliland (which gives a good account of the conflict, though just from the perspective of one soldier).  I don't think you need to do any more than mention the conflict, but a good source is  if you want it."

 About """"Two Chinas"""" 

I re-wrote and expanded the """"History"""" section for several reasons.
 One, I think """"Background"""" is more appropriate since the article is about the term """"Two Chinas"""". There is no actual thing as """"Two Chinas"""". So a section that deals with the background of the situation described by the term is better called """"Background"""" and not """"History"""" - """"History"""" should be used for a section on the history of the term.
 Two, there was a lot of misleading content in the article, such as the stuff about the Ruijin Soviet: I've seen that claim (that the Ruijin Soviet was the first time there were """"two Chinas"""") bandied about in online forums and anti-Communist China magazines from time to time, but it is factually untrue, since China was split between many autonomous entities throughout the Republican period, and the Ruijin Soviet was no different from any of them.
 In re-writing the Background section I was hoping to illustrate that history of division and separation in order to place the final division that led eventually to the current situation in a historical context.

I don't want to get back into the debate. My latest run-in with the Indian flag-wavers (thanks for noticing, btw) has made me very disillusioned, and I will trust your good judgment to trim, edit, or restore whatever parts of the text as you see fit. Cheers,  (Talk) """

I have added a section on the law of Kamma. I prefer to call it Kamma (pali) instead of Karma ( sanskrit) as there is a negative meaning associated with Karma. Karma in the Hindu context means that ones deeds performed in previous lives are responsible for ones present conditions. This is a very pernicious Hindu doctrine and has been advanced by Hindu priests to escape from the social responsibility of alleaviting a man's condition. As per this doctrine all the poverty stricken, destitute people in this world must have been criminals in their previous lives. This cannot be true

The Buddhist law of kamma differs from the Hindu theory of Karma in this aspect. The buddhist law of kamma states that all actions are irreversable. That one cannot get rid of ones sins by asking for forgiveness or taking a bath in the holy river. An act once performed will leave its effect permanently on the society. It is the law of kamma that explains the maintainance of moral order in the world. It has nothing to do with the fortunes or misfortunes of people due to their actions in the previous birth."

Pyanda reminds me of Juan de Fuca: someone who commanded an expedition that supposedly accomplished quite a bit by a person that actually existed, but was recorded years after the fact (Fuca's three decades to Pyanda's century), with little or no primary documents supporting any of the discoveries. Shouldn't we be more cautious in reporting his (perhaps) fictional expedition?"

 Cafe Racer 

Hi,

I'd like to be pedantic here. Can you help me move Cafe racer back to Cafe Racer.

A Cafe Racer is a Cafe Racer. Not a Café Racer.

Indeed, they were originally spoken """" Caff Racers """" as they were used to race from Caff [ pronounced Kaff ] to Caff.

Singapore is a different world to Australia and a different world to where I'm in. The last weekhas been full on!!!!

Lord of the Rings was created here (Not the Movie) but the story trilogy was here. England is sort of similar to Australia, only older, more history, more pubs,more people,tiny parking spaces and so many red double decker buses. I'm doing all right for money and spent some at London's Best Gamesworkshop in Oxford Street. Gamesworkshops are bigger and better in England. I have been to a couple but can't buy much because of space in my ags. Rohan & Saun would love these Gamesworkshops in England. There are Mini Gamesworkshops in Villages smaller than Broadford, and still they are fanstatic. Bigger Gamesworkshops are manily in more bigger Towns and Cities eg Nottingham, London, Mancester, Oxford and many more. Tell Rohan that i went past the Gamesworkshop Headquarters, the Citadel Miniatures Factory and Warhammer World in Nottingham. But Unfortunaly i could not go because we had no time because our destination was Derbyshire and ran out of time. But I certainly will go there when i come back to England if i have time.

0,"Lists that combine categories 

On the AfD for List of Jewish American criminals and victims you wrote Comment Does anyone think that this sort of list is substantially different from List of Jewish actors and actresses? If so, I'd like to understand exactly why.

I don't know if you're aware that in January 06 there was extensive discussion of the issue of lists that try and combine a person's ethnic or religious affiliation with something completely unrelated to that. The extreme example discussed at some length there was List of Methodist dentists. I missed that discussion, but having looked through it recently as I've watch the AfD comments I'm really disappointed that the community did not come to an acceptable consensus on the question. 

I see a difference between the list you cite and the list under discussion primarily because the 'criminals and victims' is so contentious and potentially offensive. We've seen the comments from User: GorillazFanAdam. While I can see some way in which a list of people who were victims because they were Jewish (gay, missionaries) could have merit (but I'm not sure it warrants inclusion on Wikipedia), I cannot see how a list of criminals could have the same merit. To act in a manner that is criminal is effectively a declaration that the faith into which you were born, or claim by conversion, is effectively a sham. So I am against the list of criminals and victims remaining not only because it not doing anything of value in the context of an encyclopedia but because it is potentially offensive.

As for the list of actors, I am against their creation since they do not seem to have encyclopedic value. Such a list combines two aspects of a person's life that do not inherently have value. A list of Jewish scholars of Christianity, for example, might be a very interesting list. There is a category combination that i see has genuine value. It was said that a List of Islamicist athletes has values because such athletes choose to recognise aspects of the Koran in the way that they compete (women wearing a burka [spelling?] for example). 

So I've come to the position that both lists you mention are unencyclopedic, but was willing to accept the view of a majority that a  List of Jewish actors and actresses was something I can put up with. A List of Jewish American criminals and victims is too contentious to remain."

Hello, Arjuna rubbo-ferraro, 

I wanted to let you know that there's a discussion about whether Perfect World Depression: The Fourth Wall Organization should be deleted. Your comments are welcome at  Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Perfect World Depression: The Fourth Wall Organization . 

If you're new to the process, articles for deletion is a group discussion (not a vote!) that usually lasts seven days. If you need it, there is a guide on how to contribute. Last but not least, you are highly encouraged to continue improving the article; just be sure not to remove the tag about the deletion nomination from the top.

 My concern about your username 
Hello, EELVIS AARON PPRESLY, and welcome to Wikipedia!

I hope not to seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome, but I noticed your username, and am concerned that it might not meet Wikipedia's username policy. After you look over that policy, could we discuss that concern here?{{#if:The problem is that you're username is very similar to, and may therefore be confused with, the name of Elvis Presley.|The problem is that you're username is very similar to, and may therefore be confused with, the name of Elvis Presley.}}

I'd appreciate learning your own views, for instance your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.

You have several options freely available to you:
 If you can relieve my concern through discussing it here, I can stop worrying about it.
 If the two of us can't agree here, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, such as asking for a """"third opinion"""", or requesting comments from other Wikipedians.  Wikipedia administrators usually abide by agreements reached through this process.
 You can keep your contributions history under a new username. Visit Wikipedia:Changing username and follow the guidelines there.

Let me reassure you that my writing here means I don't think your username is grossly, blatantly, or obviously inappropriate; such names get reported straight to Wikipedia:Usernames for administrator attention or blocked on sight. This is more a case where opinions might differ, and it would be good to reach some consensus — either here or at Wikipedia:Requests for comment/User names. So I look forward to a friendly discussion, and to enjoying your continued participation on Wikipedia. Thank you. ABrievenbus  Category:Usernames editors have expressed concern over  ABrievenbus """

It translates to “sensei”? It’s pronounced that way, but it translates (into English, at any rate) as “ancient sage” and usually refers to Confucius. But it has absolutely nothing to do with the word covered by this article, and the kanji are not alternates for 先生. The coincidence of pronunciation is just that: a coincidence. Nothing more, nothing less.   

I'm only asking if the kanji I listed is a archic version of the current kanji used. Plus, Confucius was a teacher so it can't be said mere coincidence.  

Suite yourself. But 先聖 is not an archaic version of 先生, and the coincidence of pronunciation is just that. This is not at all a rare phenomenon in Japanese; in fact, it is the Chinese that you should be tracking down. Whether 先聖 and 先生 are pronounced the same in Chinese, I do not know. In any case, if you introduce into the article your assumption about the two character strings being related or variant “spellings” of the same word, you will have to substantiate the assertion with a reliable source as per WP:ATT.

Why I said """"all those things""""...taking them one at at time... 
First sentence: I don't mind doing a lot of work to help someone out, even if I think that it is towards something that will eventually be deleted. I feel that the simple act of responding to someone else's good faith request for help is inherently worthy of my time. 
Second sentence: You seemed to be concerned over people's ability to find your article and impatient about how nothing was being done about it. What I did was to add something that would enable people to find your article and address your apparent concern.
Third sentence: I was/am fairly certain that the AfD discussion I linked to earlier will result in deletion of the article and its associated articles, including the article that I linked to using , especially since the first time it was there it was a unanimous decision to delete. This is no reflection on you. It is merely that I don't think the article is sufficiently noteworthy for inclusion on Wikipedia given our standards. I don't think any harm is done by linking to it, but if your article is deleted we will need to remove the link to it.
Fourth sentence: Every time you use  it creates a new alert in the IRC channel I was trying to get you to join. It is quite annoying when people repeatedly use it. 
I hope that clarifies things. I thought that I had helped you in pointing you towards the AfD, explaining where to find things and the rationale behind their movement. The fact that I disagree with you about the inclusion of the article shouldn't invalidate all the help I gave, should it? That doesn't seem right to me. I am sorry if you felt that I was being egregiously unhelpful. I want you to know that I have argued on your behalf against blocking you, but if you continue to threaten disruptive behavior to make a point regarding your feelings of unjust deletion I will no longer be able to assume good faith.

 Lua readership has doubled from 2009/2010: I was looking back to Lua readership in 2009, which I had forgotten was an issue back then, so no wonder the installation of Lua seemed like a will-it-ever-arrive frustration. Anyway, back in 2009, there were ~640 Lua pageviews per day, but later increased in 2010 to 720/day, and now we have ~1,280/day. Compare the growth of January pageview graphs in years 2009-2013:

 I think the map is a decent enough feature - it's certainly useful for anyone who doesn't want to wade through the data to see what the overall picture is! However, I agree with the poster above that the """"last poll"""" methodology is somewhat crude - it makes the map too volatile and is open to too much interpretation (if two polls come out on the same day, which is the last one?) I think a rolling average would be too difficult to keep up to date  and too prone to errors - so what I'd suggest is the following: Each poll is scored as Obama, Clinton or Tie (if the lead is less than the margin of error). Then every time a new poll is added, the person adding it does a simple count of the number of """"wins"""" each candidate has in the last three days' polls. If either candidate has a majority, they are awarded the state. If not, it's scored as a tie. If there are no objections, I am happy to go through and do this for the existing data.   20:06"""

No it is not valid, you can't write """"Daisuke Kawasaki"""" because he is not a person of note, when a reader wants to check who the author is, there is barely any information about him apart from blogs (even in Japanese) If it was written by Hidekazu Yoshida or someone like Pauline Kael then it is of some note (but still not in the lead) It is not an achievement, and only because other articles do it doesn't make it acceptable. It is no different to this situation, what one can assume to be """"teenage fans"""" are entering this stuff into articles and watching to ensure its not removed, when it is fancruft nonsense which is why the US/Australian magazines etc make this sort of stuff, easy money. Another major point to be made is that you don't speak Japanese and you have not read the magazine, you are referencing a website which itself hasn't done any research (but you call reliable) and is simply reposting what neojaponisme said. Interestingly this is exactly where all the information about this list comes from, and neojaponisme is not a reliable source, it is a blog site. They could of changed parts of it or made it up entirely to put in what they wanted The list itself was called biased by it's own publisher Rolling Stone (and they distanced themselves from it, even writing 独断と偏見で選んだ on the cover!!) the list is not written by someone of note, it is written by a self-published defunct fanzine owner (how amusing, a fancruft list written by a fanzine writer) You yourself can pitch an idea to a magazine and get it published, you just have to convince them it will be good for sales.

0,"Babak and Persians 

Hey Tajik, thanks for the BBC article. I did want to talk to you though with regards to the stuff going with the Persians. I noticed some activity there and realized that someone has added Tajiks as 'Persians', which in effect negates the Tajiks page. Now the problem with this is the article on the Persians will turn into a massive article describing cultural variations and divergent histories etc. I'm not sure this is a good way to go. Tajiks are indeed Persians, but are as distinct as the Slovaks are from the Czechs or the Croats from Serbs (both groups speak mutually intelligible languages or basically the same language). In addition, as you well know, many, if not most, don't call themselves Persians anyway (most I've met refer to themselves as Afghans or will talk of their 'Aryan' lineage). The way we've set it up, on Iranian peoples was good in that we had Tajiks as a sub-type of Persians (which I believe you put in), and thus can have their own article as both a closely related type of Central Asian Persians and as an Iranian people with many distinct qualities of their own (linking them more to Persians in northeast Iran rather than those of western Iran), including the Tajiks of Tajikistan. In addition, most references distinguish between the two, while clarifying Tajiks as an Iranian people, usually referred to as Central Asian Persians. In short, after all this, I think it's a huge mistake to subsume the Tajiks given the weight of history and divergence that has taken place simply due to the vast geographic expanse and the Tajiks own unique qualities.

Tennis expert is beyond a joke.  his behavior is consistently atrocious. he act like god and chief censor. he never backs up any of his edits with common decent argument. He accusses any one who challenges his edits as  vandalism. he defends the indefensible. he censors criticism. he is constently rude to other editors. he should be banned. he is a bully boy who redits any edit within minutes (nobody else does this). he is reknowed for getting in edit wars (see tennis statistics) and he is consistently rude to other editors (see remarks to carlo coluusi in jimmy connors and german friend in rod laver) He has been a rude menance since last november. His behaviour is awful; I may have used rude language, but as far as iu'm concerned rude, uncvilised behavior is far worse. he should be stopped. he's  the one starting calling every redit of his work incvil vandalism, when it was nothing of the kind. he's the one who did the silly edit of removing laver's total wins year by year; abosulte nonsense. this man is so arrogant and (look at his name: his ego is gigantic) petty he would drive anybody to bad langage and aggressive remarks; he should be banned. ask carlo and german friend about his behaviour.
Thyis man is a liar. nobody else has backed up his edits ; what a joke; he is a minority of one. the tables were perfectly consisent and sensible back in october before tennis ego arrived.
you don't put citations when the info comes from the main sources as this silly man has been consistently requesting . and you don't put incitations when the source is obvious ( ie rod lavers's quote after a match obviously comes from his press conference). this man has driven me up the wall with his stubbornness. you should get evidence from other witneesse before bowing to the snide requests of tennis ego.

Again, NK never existed as a region before 1920s. While Nagorno translates as mountainous, it was never a separate region. And NK as a region is separated from Armenia by Kelbajar, Lachin and other districts of Azerbaijan. The sources above do not say that NK existed as a stand alone region historically. Even Russian imperial administrative divisions such as Jevanshir and Shusha uyezds included both mountainous and lowland parts of the region. So we need to clarify that NK as a region did not border Armenia. If we are talking about geographic region of Karabakh, then its mountainous part extends right to the border with Armenia, however upper and lower Karabakh historically formed a single region, and geographic concept of Karabakh includes both highlands and lowlands. The history of NK as a historical and political notion starts in 1920s, when it was artificially carved out of Karabakh to become an autonomy for Armenians. It was purely a Soviet invention. master """

Yes, I am aware that there is no reference in the Australian Census about Latinos but this is trivial, there does not need to be any reference. You seemed to be confused on who actually is Latino and this seems to be your main point of debate. Going by your logic the pages Anglo-Celtic Australian and Black Australian should be drawn into question as they are also not referenced in the Australian Census. The rest of the page shouldn't need citations and references as no more information than what is available in the census is really given. And how exactly am I wrong? """"I'm not saying that your entirely wrong"""" Again this opinion seems to me, to have come from your belief that I am not aware of what or who a Latino is, and in my opinion, no offense intended, is due to yourself not grasping the concept of a Latino.

This is exactly what Latinos are, of different ancestral, ethnic and national backgrounds. This is the great and unique thing about Latinos is that they can be White, Black, American Indian, Asian, Multiracial and of all different nationalities.

 Changes between editions

The part """"Former Mormons, and now critics of the LDS church,"""" was just added and it raises a question in my mind.

It seems from our article that """"official Church publications"""" and critics of the church AGREE that there have been numerous changes to the text of the Book of Mormon.  If so, the numerous changes seem to be a matter of fact, not a matter of controversy.

In this case, could the section be written in a more straightforward way?  In particular, starting the section with the views of two critics of the church seems to me to suggest that it is a matter of controversy.

I like that you started with a clear definition of a Preparator and Art Handler and next described the responsibilities of the role.

I would just like to suggest that similar to the roles of Registrar and Collections Manager, in some institutions there may be differences between the roles of Preparator and Art Handler. For example, the last Preparator who worked for me was also responsible for helping prep and customize the storage areas, photographing objects (as part of cataloging) and exhibition installations, and ensuring frames and hanging hardware were in good condition, which may not be typical art handling functions in some types of institutions. As you described I often engaged outside art handlers when I had to move a lot of art quickly, such as when the museum’s board of directors decided to paint the entire museum and gave me only a week to prepare.

Another great reference for professional Preparators and Art Handlers is the Preparation, Art Handling, Collections Care Information Network (PACCIN )

Sure, what's great for me isn't necessarilly great for you; but when something is great for the many, the qualification becomes objective.  Hellmuth is regularly the chosen televised table, and was invited to this year's tournament of champions event (despite not qualifying) solely for his television appeal.  He currently has logged more minutes on ESPN than any other player.  I'm sorry if you don't know this subject well enough to understand it, but Hellmuth is univerally known and agreed to produce great television.  If I watched Michael Jordan play basketball and thought he was bad, it would not change the fact that he could be objectively described as a """"great"""" basketball player.  Please stick to material that you understand well enough to be able to determine what is subjective and what is not.  I see in your profile that you are interested in photography; I'm sure there are plenty of photography related sections that you could do better work with."""

 Poltergeist 

I see you have removed the link I recently added to the poltergeist article. Your justification for this is """"fringe paper in a psychic journal on 'strange' sounds, I don't see why this is relevant to this article."""" Let's examine that step by step.

(1) Fringe paper. The paper is by Dr Barrie G. Colvin. This is what Bloomberg Business says about him:

Dr. Barrie G. Colvin is the founder and Managing Director of IFS Chemicals Ltd. Dr. Barrie Colvin is a polyurethane technologist with significant experience in the formulated systems market in Europe. He attended the University of Manchester Institute of Science & Technology and obtained a B.Sc. (Honours) degree in Polymer Technology (Chemistry). Following three years of research in the area of X-ray crystallography of polymers, he was awarded a Ph.D. from the same University. In 1973, Barrie Colvin joined Shell Research Ltd. as a polyurethane technologist, specialising in fire-retardant foams and new generation appliance insulation. In 1975, he worked on the development of base polyols for rigid foam applications followed by several years as Technical Manager for a polyurethane systems house in the UK. In 1982, Barrie Colvin founded IFS, a polyurethane formulating company, specialising in rigid and semi-rigid foams as well as speciality elastomers. The IFS Group is committed to the development of more environmentally acceptable polyurethane chemicals, having introduced a zero ODP insulation foam to the commercial refrigeration market in 1988. More recently, the company has successfully implemented the use of polyols based upon natural oils.

And this is his profile on LinkedIn:

As the principal shareholder (90%) in IFS Chemicals, Envirofoam Chemicals and Bollards International, my main activities centre around the development and manufacture of bespoke chemical systems for a wide variety of industries. My principal expertise is in the formulation of polyurethanes for industrial applications, ranging from insulation products, automotive mouldings, sub-sea pipeline protection systems, various marine applications etc. I have done this type of work all my working life (40 years) and continue to remain very hands-on in the laboratory development of newer, improved systems. The success of these companies can be attributed to the dedication of the staff at our factory in Roydon, Norfolk. Our aim to to [sic] provide customers with the very best, bespoke product for their intended application, backed up by the very best, most experienced field engineers who help to turn chemicals into products.

An equally important part of my time involves my participation within the Society for Psychical Research. This organization gets involved with the scientific study of claims of paranormal activity and over the years has included many eminent scientists, including a number of Nobel prizewinners. Many members of the Society have come to recognize that the known laws of physics cannot explain some of the more unusual phenomena that have been shown to exist in the world around us. As an example, there is a wealth of evidence supporting the objective nature of psychokinesis but, as yet, there is no generally accepted theory of how """"mind-over-matter"""" might work. I am a member of the Council of the Society for Psychical Research and have been very actively involved with the Spontaneous Cases Committee for some years. Whilst I have been involved with many aspects of the paranormal, my main interest is in the area of poltergeist activity (also known as RSPK—Recurrent Spontaneous PsychoKinesis).

(2) Psychic journal. I think I detect a note of disdain. The paper appeared in the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research. As indicated by Dr Colvin in his LinkedIn profile, the Society for Psychical Research is dedicated to the scientific study of allegedly paranormal phenomena and its membership has over the years included many eminent scientists, among them a number of Nobel laureates.

(3) Strange sounds. Did you read the paper? The strange sounds in question are poltergeist rappings.

I am going to restore the link and would be grateful if you would let it stand.

Paul talks about the war because that is what the liberal media types want to talk about, but I have seen several reports that the average """"conservative voter"""" is not primarily concerned with the war and wants to hear much more about real border security, stopping abortion on demand and protecting second amendment rights; in this specific order.  Many neo-cons want the war to continue and don't want to talk about it at all; I don't agree with that either, it should be fully discussed. However, Paul says that he would much rather discuss other conservative issues and that the war is only discussed because the media types bring it up. I just think that we should consider making the order that which is the priority of our primary audience for this page. If conservatives are coming to this page with particular interests and priorties, why should we let the liberally biased mainstream media dictate the order; after all they won't even print a fair and objective story on the good man or reveal details of how their secretive """"scientific polls"""" are conducted or whether he was excluded altogether?

0,"""First of all, the Gibson report is not a government report. Not that it matters, because stating that government reports are by nature reliable is ridiculous. Now, the reliability of any source can be questioned, which results in a discussion. This discussion is settled with arguments. It is not required that such arguments are themselves held to the same standard as the article text, so arguments being, for instance, original research, can be perfectly alright, as long as they are not cited in the article. On a talk page, we are not editors. MastCell is fundamentally wrong.  

I'm sorry but I think both mast cell and the unregistered user misunderstand the issue here. JFW has expressed an intention to publish unsubtantiated, inflammatory claims which will be to the detriment of a patient community, from an unreliable source. Suzy Chapman and I have been trying to illustrate how unreliable the source is and how unsubstantiated the claims are. We have been providing copious evidence and plausible arguments as to why, but frankly it feels we are running around in circles. We are certainly not engaging in 'spurious arguments'. IF this goes ahead, the reputation of Wikipedia, Simon Wessely himself and possibly the Gibson may be severely damaged, because public calls for full verification will have to be made by the patient community, and Wikipedia's displayed determination to publish unsubstantiated, inflammatory claims from unreliable sources (NOT a government document). Suzy has attempted to resolve this problem by verifying the situation by Gibson himself via letter. But neither of us have suggested to phone up the subject on the phone: Sciencewatcher has. So already we have misreading of the facts being exhibited here.

But in addition there is a marked inconsistency here: all sorts of debate goes on at Wikipedia. Calling the discussion """"the din of argumentation, speculation, unverfiable personal commentary"""" DOES NOT MAKE IT SO just because you say. And just because you can't be bothered to study the points does not make the points irrelevant! I have developed quite a lot of familiarity with Wikipedia processes, and both Mast Cell and the unregistered user don't seem to be following them. I suggest that certain people stop pulling Wiki-rank 'I know more about Wiki than you' and act responsibly in this, for Wikipedia and the subject concerned, if not for a patient community.

I've seen listings here on Wikipedia that have had the same tags for years, and nothing more ever happened.

It was on an amendment to the Bill, not the Bill itself (the amendment would have required the prosecution to prove that a statement was intended to incite terrorism, rather than that it might have that effect, in order to secure a conviction). The original result announced was Ayes 299, Noes 300. Had Galloway attended he would have voted Aye and the result would have been declared a tie at 300, but the Speaker would have given his casting vote to the Noes in line with precedent that a tie on an amendment is broken in the direction of the Bill as originally introduced. (It subsequently turned out that the tellers had counted one extra MP as voting Aye and the result was actually 298 to 300, but that is not particularly relevant)

The point for the mention is not that Galloway's absence actually deprived the opposition of the chance to defeat the government, but that following the vote, many people said that it did. Given the high profile which Galloway gave to this aspect of politics, it was not surprising that his absence was particularly noteworthy.  | Talk"

anyway:

as SAS ownes the majority stake in arBaltic and a 49% stake in Estonian Air with whome they have a close coopeartion, so it's very likely that these two airlines will go the way that Blue1 already went and join the alliance as Regional Members.

Air One is very close with Lufthansa and fully integrated in Lufthansa's Miles&More; FFP. In fact they are the only fully integrated Airline that is not a Star Alliance member yet. But that seems to be a matter of time.

At the very moment Austrian Airlines ownes a 49% Stake in Slovak Airlines. As the Slovak government is planning to sell off the remaining stake in that airline it is highly likely that Austrian will accquire these stakes. A Star Alliance membership is absolutely possible. 

Silk Air is a fully owned subsidiary of Singapore Airlines. I won't comment on that, as I have never heard of them being a candidate for Alliance membership, but doesn't seem unlikely.

Aegean Airlines and Lufthansa started cooperation last year and according to some statements in the German press both airlines seem to be very interessted in Aegean joining the Alliance.

Luxair has strong ties to Lufthansa and Austrian... might not be joining in the nearest future, but would definitely be welcome in the Alliance

Since you removed Qatar Airways from the list of possible members... It's no secret that Star is really interessterd in Qatar Airways. On the other hand Qatar Airways strengthened their cooperation with Lufthansa, ANA and United last year... they are definitely leaning towards Star Alliance.

They are at least as likely to join Star as TAM or SN Brussles etc. to join OneWorld / Malaysia Airlines to join Skyteam"

 Dubious editing 

User:Mr. Stradivarius has consistently removed heavily sourced paragraphs and kept replacing them, until just recently, with unsourced hagiography. The following are the sourced (which he maliciously calls unsourced) paragraphs that were removed: 
TAB
According to former Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky, in his book By Way of Deception, the Mossad """"was deeply involved with several other warring Lebanese families, paying for information, passing it between groups, even paying the gangs and some Palestinians in the refugee camps for intelligence and services. Besides Gemayel, both the Jumblatt and Berri families were on the Mossad payroll. Source: Ostrovsky, Victor (1990). By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer, p. 316
TAB
Berri is involved in corruption allegations regarding a 1996 coastal motorway in southern Lebanon. The contract for the motorway was won by a firm run by Berri's wife, Randa Assi, and was said to be overpriced by over three hundred million US dollars. Sources: Johnson, Michael (2001). All Honorable Men: The Social Origins Of War In Lebanon , p.236; Schwerna, Tobias (2010). Lebanon: A Model of Consociational Conflict , p.128. 

In 2004, Berri was mentioned in several of the diplomatic cables leaked by WikiLeaks. One cable said that Amal is """"near universally derided as corrupt to the core"""", and that Berri was described by a relative of Musa al-Sadr as having provided social services in the south only through """"wheeling, dealing, and stealing"""". Also according to the cables, Berri receives USD 400,000 a month from Iran, using a fourth of the sum to shore up his support and pocketing the rest. Sources: Gloria Center, Wikileaks cables. 

According to one source, Berri was considered by Rafik Hariri to be """"irredeemably corrupt and unreliable"""", as well as an opportunist, and is thought to maintain his support base through access to state funds. Source:  Blanford, Nicholas (2006). Killing Mr. Lebanon: The Assasination of Rafik Hariri and Its Impact on the Middle East , p. 118

According to leaked diplomatic cables, during the 2006 Lebanon war, Berri, publicly an ally of Hezbollah, described Israel's attacks on Hezbollah to US Ambassador Jeffrey Feltman as being """"like honey"""", and hoped that Israel would complete its mission against Hezbollah quickly. He suggested that the IDF """"markedly improve its targeting intelligence to make air strikes more effective. Either that, or they would have to wipe Hizballah out of the south with a ground offensive."""" He also suggested that """"if Israel succeeds in weakening Hizballah militarily, then he will be more willing to weaken them politically"""". Sources: Wikileaks cables, NOW Media, Aspen Institute, Middle East Online. 

Berri's sister-in-law and close business associate Samira Assi, is said to have made a fortune by getting a contract from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to print one million copies of Gaddafi's """"Green Book"""". Assi's deals are seen as highly controversial, since the founder of the Amal Movement, Musa al-Sadr, is known to have been disappeared on the orders of Gaddafi himself. Sources: Middle East Intelligence Bulletin report, written by the current news director of Congress-funded Al Hurra.

 Italics for words-as-words 

In plant articles, like Pumpkin, it is normal to use quotation marks rather than italics as per MOS:WORDSASWORDS: """"When italics could cause confusion, quotation marks instead may be used to distinguish words as words.""""

I don't think the change you made at Pumpkin matters, but elsewhere it might create confusion for readers not familiar with the scientific names involved.

0,"Hello ,

My name is Mrs. Rebecca Song, a Portuguese national .I have been diagnosed with Esophageal  cancer which has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts. 

As you read this, you do not have to feel sorry for me as it is a universal truth that we all must die someday. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that
was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just accumulating all the wealth in the world as I lay helplessly on my sick bed.

If I was given a second chance to live again, I'm sure I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it owing to what has befallen me now. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few close friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Somalia and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan; they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Seventy Five Million United States Dollars ($75, 000, 000.00) that I have with a Finance Vaulting Unit in Europe.

All I am asking of you is to assist me in making the collection of this deposit and dispatching the funds to any
charity of your choice.

N/B: Kindly note that 30% of this funds must go to the tsunami victims, 50% to other Charity Organization and 20% for your effort and time. I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation,as I am using my Lap Top Computer to communicate with you.

Please contact me as soon as you get this email if you are capable and sincere to handle this transaction on my behalf so that I can forward to you all relevant documents necessary for the claims and the name of the security firm where the funds are deposited and a picture of my present condition.

There is a scammer targeting HIV dating sites (as well as other free sites including POF) using Ms. Billards photos and information.

If you 'meet' somebody purporting to be Ms. Billard on a dating site, please be aware that it is not the real Bobbi Billard.  If you get an e-mail from this person, please reverse-search their headers.  They consistently come back to Nigeria and Ghana.  But please note that it is not *this* Bobbi Billard (sometimes spelled 'Billiard') on the dating site.  The same scammer has been in operation since at least 2005.

On the second occasion,  at least had the common courtesy to follow policy and provide an edit summary. Since the article was my contribution, and since I feel that Wikipedia should include an article on this subject, I am responding here.

The edit summary states: """"This page is nothing but WP:OR. There is no """"fallacy"""". Best as a redirect""""

The last point might have force if use/mention fallacies were defined on the redirect page, but they are not. Indeed, they are not mentioned at all. Furthermore, I can make no sense of the second point. Interpreted as """"there is no such recognised thing as a use/mention fallacy"""" it is obviously false, as can easily be shown by a google search (=use mention fallacy). The first ten results alone include citable examples dating back more than three decades. (Specifically, John R Searle's December 1976 review of """"Toward a Linguistic Theory of Speech Acts"""" by Jerrold M Sadock in Language: """"There seems to me to be several massive use-mention fallacies in this .... But this has the effect of building a persistent use-mention fallacy into ..."""") I don't want to insult Snalwibma's intelligence by implying he or she didn't bother to try this search, but I can't otherwise understand the criticism.

I'm less sure of my ground when it comes to the allegation of WP:OR. The example isn't mine, but I got it from the oral tradition (and changed 'nigger' to 'honky', mainly because I'm white myself), so can't cite anything to justify it. But I don't accept that inventing illustrative examples counts as WP:OR. If it did, the consequences for Wikipedia would be unfortunate, for whereas it might just be possible to quote a citable definition under fair use of copyright, quoting copyrighted examples is surely not on. So contributors must invent them if we are avoid an encyclopedia of merely abstract prose that only makes sense if you already know what it means.

I'm just annoyed because Rant Media does quite obviously deserve an article by WP's guidelines. However, because the people who've made Rant articles and SK articles on Wikipedia over the past 5 years have often done such a bad job, writing articles that read like spam, not following Wikipedia's standard format, we've now ended up in a situation where the AfD can result in a salt - that's where they """"salt the earth"""" so the article can never again be created.

What matters is that the various Wikipedia editors in AfD see that you've followed the rules: that your article is as good as any others and that it's as well-sourced as any others. If you've been watching and listening to Sean Kennedy you already know that. Infiltration requires not being seen to be the enemy.

It's the only real article I've ever worked on, and I had to learn all the footnoting and formatting from scratch. If I can make that article acceptable, you can easily make a RantMedia article acceptable.

Mr. Davis,

Thanks for your note on my talk page; I really appreciate it, and it's an honor to receive communication from the author of such an important book.  As this article's creator and main editor, I'm sorry that you thought the review section was so negative.  Please understand that it was not my intention to present it that way or that I was in any way trying to disparage your book.  In my rush to get the article published, I did a google search and those are the reviews I found.  Also please understand that this is a Wikipedia article, and the article as it now stands will never be """"complete"""".  It's a work in progress.  I thought an article about Street Gang was important enough to get out there.  I am by no means a professional writer, so I'm certain there are all kinds of weaknesses about it, so I depend upon the feedback of other more experienced editors.  I would've thought that the other sections of the article demonstrates my respect for you and for your work.  I appreciate your feedback, something I always welcome as a Wikipedia editor.  If you are aware of other sources that I wasn't able to locate, please send them my way, on my talk page.  I'll repeat this message via your webpage, to ensure that you see it.

You should also know that I've taken it upon myself to improve all Sesame Street-related articles on Wikipedia.  It's a big project, and a great need.  For example, Sesame Street, at one point was actually a featured article, but it was recently downgraded for some really good reasons.  It's an unfortunate state at the current time.  Your book came out shortly after I took on the project, so it's been a boom for me.  I thought focusing on the history of the show was a natural place to start, so your book has been a valuable resource.  I've already started working on this article: History of Sesame Street, and if you look at the reference section, you'll see that I've used your book extensively.  It's also a work in progess, and no where near finished.  My goal is that at least this article get up to featured article status by Sesame Street's 40th anniversary in November.  I can't tell you how much your book has helped me.

On a personal level, I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed your book.  It was a fun read, and immensely interesting.  I was brought to tears many times, especially when I realized while reading about all that Joan Cooney and her team did to get the show on the air.  See, I'm turning 45 this year, which makes me old enough to be the first audience that watched it.  I had to put the book down to compose myself when I realized, """"They did all that for me!""""  I appreciate learning about the struggles they all went through to affect my life so profoundly, and now the life of my own children, who are severely developmentally disabled and love the show as much as I did and still do.  I believe that Sesame Street deserves high quality articles on Wikipedia, and I've taken it upon myself to help accomplish that.  If you, as the ultimate expert, could assist me in that goal, I can't tell you how valuable that would be.  Again, thanks for the feedback and communication.   """

The categories the articles are in are all in the spirituality category themselves.

So nothing's actually been removed from spirituality at all. But again, my apologies if my actions have been disruptive

BTW, I've just noted from your user page that you have a particular concern with the New Thought movement. I did move several of their pages and they had to go a couple of places down the category tree because of where the current subcategories are. May I suggest that you either move the New Thought sub-category up the tree so that it's directly under spirituality or simply place just the lead article  for New Thought in the Spirituality category if that's your main concern? Spirituality is quite a high domain category so every single article under its domain cannot appear there - most of them will need to be in sub-categories."

delete the link.

As much as human rights and ethnic rights should be respected, spray painting every possible detail of unverifiable information on the Rohingya, and getting around the verification by claiming that the information was destroyed by an interested party - are not valid reasons for having a list of villages where a certain group of people live.

Your own description of the two sides seems to more clearly get at the problem here. There is nothing in the dictionary (or in the general definition of a capital) that makes recognition a prerequisite for a city being a capital, but there's also nothing in the dictionary saying it isn't. Likewise, there is nothing in the dictionary (or in the general definition of a country) that makes recognition a prequisite for a region being a country, but there's also nothing in the dictionary saying it isn't. Yet, in the latter case, I'm sure most here would agree that without recognition, a country is nothing, and really is not a country at all. Does the same apply to capitals? Well, we have limited situations in which this is even a question, and unfortunately the primary situation is this one, coming in the context of a bitter, and ultimately stupid, conflict. I personally think the same standard does not apply to capitals, as there is something physical (e.g. government institutions, place of residence of the head of state) to denote the capital. But if one operates under the belief that a state (and we all agree Israel is one, right?) can be without a capital, then maybe one can believe that recognition is a pre-requisite for capital status.

It's something that we don't tend to recommend because a lot of the tools are really easy to go wrong on. I know when I first used Twinkle I somehow managed to screw that up as well. 

But besides that, I'm sure having one more vandal fighter, regardless how new, is never a bad thing for Wikipedia, right? So my suggestion to you would be to get adopted by a more experienced user. (I'm still learning the ropes myself, and being adopted has been immensely helpful, if only to know that there's people I can go to for help.) Wikipedia is a really hard community to become part of sometimes, and I'm afraid you've been one of those who's had a bit of a rough time getting settled. I hope it does get better for you- and I think getting mentored by someone will help you greatly with that.

0,"WP:WEB

I don't know what you mean by jumping to conclusions, but noted nonetheless. To address your example directly, Dominic Deegan was actually printed, published, and released, which gives it a  bit of a foothold in the webcomic world. It has tens of thousands of Google hits, the first several hundred of which are unique and relevant, and several hundred unique sites also link to it. It also gets a couple million views per month according to Alexa.com. The three methods on their own are not always the best for rating the notability of a subject, but when combined, they give a clearer picture

Some articles are marked for deletion soon after creation, and others aren't marked until several months (or years) after their first edit. However, in the end, they will eventually receive the same scrutiny all other articles must undergo- an unencyclopedic article will not be allowed to exist on the premise that other unencyclopedic articles already exist; they will, in all likelihood, be deleted eventually as well.

As for WP:WEB itself: It's a guideline used to help determine the notability of the site. While the majority of sites that do not meet the criteria are deleted, all of those that do meet the criteria are kept. This criteria is an extension of the following policies:

 Wikipedia:Verifiability
 Wikipedia:Neutral point of view
 Wikipedia:No original research

The following guidelines:

 Wikipedia:Cite sources
 Wikipedia:Reliable sources

And the following tests:

 Wikipedia:Search engine test

Basically, if the site has independent material published about it, receives an award, or is distributed through a notable publisher, information about it can be verified and, most importantly, neutral. This avoids original research. This also allows us to cite reliable sources; Wikipedia is not a primary source or publisher of original research/information. WP:WEB is basically the condensed version of several other policies and guidelines aimed specficially towards websites."

Nope, I didn't read the guide to appealing, didn't have time. The user in question IS engaged in harassment, I've been doing this long enough to know and I can prove it. He/she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page, reverted the article while I was in the midst of editing it (my second pass, couldn't even preview changes), then changed his/her mind as to my real wiki-sin, since the onus for proving the Doris Day available as PD on archive.org was on him/her not me and the usual span for pre-Bern had expired long ago, ... decided my REAL sin was Original Research (oh noes), and continued to revert based on that. Does OR add clutter? Sure it can, but if the user in question was REALLY concerned about that, about the quality of the article and about extraneous details, WHY DIDN'T HE/SHE EVEN NOTICE two paragraphs already there, comprising about 1/3 of the entire article, dealt with Norman Schwarzkopf, an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name? I'll tell you why: the user wasn't engaged in good-faith/goodwill editing and the normal back-and-forth that leads to better articles. He/she was involved in blocking input to the article. Why? Was it personal against me, or was it to preserve the existing content of the article, including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? I can only speculate, but I'd guess it's some sort of power trip and wiki-bullying. I don't really have time for this. I have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isn't directly related to content and improving articles. I could pretend this user didn't do what he/she did, but I'm wasting my own time here and I don't really have a stake in any such pretense. I don't have any stake in improving this article either, no dog in the race, I just see how it can be improved and made more informative. As a long-term wikipedia user and editor, I don't see any problem in jumping in and fixing something. I almost expect some sort of pushback now, but not over completely minor edits which are very good and on-target in very minor stub-like articles. The problem isn't me here, it's that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior, and they are getting away with it, wikipedia becomes a much poorer place, a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share. Also, I don't recal ever having called him/her a bot, I think you put those words in my mouth, perhaps inadvertently. His/her behavior is malicious, but probably not malware, just the normal human collection of problems. I think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper, he/she isn't quite qualified for that at this point anyway, and it's having a very chilling effect across wikipedia. I won't egnage in a battle of the wikipedia rule acronyms, I will continue to write in English, and to read articles on wikipedia in English, and to think of ways to improve them in English. I am fully aware of how the terms """"vandlism"""" are used and misused here, and most of the rest of the wikijargon. Nothing new under the sun here. If you read the edits I made carefully, and note the times of the reverts and the history of actions by that other user, you will see I'm not off the mark here at all. I know what's going on.

0,"This is a question best raised on the NoScript support forums. However, I can comment on a few of the differences:
 CSP is server-side (has to be configured at each server, sends reports to the server), while ABE is client-side (configured in browser, logs results in error console).
 CSP just allows or blocks content, whereas ABE can take other actions like stripping authentication.
 CSP was primarily designed to stop cross-site scripting and other injections, while ABE was primarily designed to stop cross-site request forgery (but can defeat XSS/injections too).
 CSP allows wildcards, ABE allows either wildcards or regular expressions.
 CSP specifies only hostnames, ABE can specify full addresses including protocol and path.
 ABE knows about intranet vs internet addresses and can control traffic between them (in fact, it does this by default).
 CSP doesn't try to control requests originating from privileged code eg browser extensions. ABE can, although it is always possible for privileged code to defeat this, so it cannot be relied on to protect against malicious addons.
 ABE can distinguish between different types of object inclusions and different HTTP methods.
 They can work independently; if either blocks something, it will be blocked.
 I don't know of any metrics on how widely CSP is deployed, nor do I have any idea how many NoScript users take the time to configure ABE (which doesn't do very much out-of-the-box)."

1) You have failed to explain what the quote does for the article besides trying to say """"Well, they're just theists, so why listen to them?"""" As I said before, the reasoning for keeping the quote would also allow us to find and add quotes along the lines of """"it must be considered that only atheists and those with a grudge against Christianity support this theory"""" - and I doubt that you would so whole-heartedly support such a quote, hmm?
2) Then where is this majority of scholars that are not historians?
Richard Burridge, Graham Gould, Van Voorst, Graham Stanton, R.T. France are heads of theology departments. I can not find whether they were taught in a divinity school, though.
Michael Grant is an atheist and a full-fledged historian.
James Frazer studied myth and religion in general.

An excerpt from online, detailing some of those who oppose the hypothesis:
""""Meier [Meie.MarJ, 23] notes that what we know about Alexander the Great could fit on only a few sheets of paper; yet no one doubts that Alexander existed. Charlesworth has written that """"Jesus did exist; and we know more about him than about almost any Palestinian Jew before 70 C.E."""" [Chars.JesJud, 168-9] Sanders [Sand.HistF, xiv] echoes Grant, saying that """"We know a lot about Jesus, vastly more than about John the Baptist, Theudas, Judas the Galilean, or any of the other figures whose names we have from approximately the same date and place."""" On the Crucifixion, Harvey writes: """"It would be no exaggeration to say that this event is better attested, and supported by a more impressive array of evidence, than any other event of comparable importance of which we have knowledge from the ancient world."""" [Harv.JesC, 11] Dunn [Dunn.EvJ, 29] provides an anecdote similar to the one above regarding Shakespeare. Referring to Wells' thesis, he writes:
 

    The alternative thesis is that within thirty years there had evolved such a coherent and consistent complex of traditions about a non-existent figure such as we have in the sources of the Gospels is just too implausible. It involves too many complex and speculative hypotheses, in contrast to the much simpler explanation that there was a Jesus who said and did more or less what the first three Gospels attribute to him. The fact of Christianity's beginnings and the character of its earliest tradition is such that we could only deny the existence of Jesus by hypothesizing the existence of some other figure who was a sufficient cause of Chrstianity's beginnings - another figure who on careful reflection would probably come out very like Jesus!

Finally, let's seal the coffin on consenus with these words from a hardened skeptic and an Emeritus Professor of History, Morton Smith [Hoff.JesH, 47-8] . Of Wells' work, this historian and skeptic of orthodox Christianity wrote:

""""I don't think the arguments in (Wells') book deserve detailed refutation.""""

""""...he argues mainly from silence.""""

""""...many (of his arguments) are incorrect, far too many to discuss in this space.""""
 

""""(Wells) presents us with a piece of private mythology that I find incredible beyond anything in the Gospels.""""

None of these scholars, we emphasize, are friends of fundamentalism or evangelical Christianity. Contrary to the protestations of the """"Jesus-myth"""" consortium, they make their statements based on evidence, not ideology. Conspiracy and bias exist only in their own imagination.

Again, the fact is is that the complaint isn't relevant. The mainstream historian position, which would hardly be mostly Christian, supports the claim that Jesus was a historical person. All that quote does is try to attack the speaker's instead of the evidence, and it would be blatantly dishonest to try to include it. Provide all the arguments for the claim that you want - but this isn't one of them. Koromon survived intact. """

Cut from article:

Detainees — held there as a part of the ongoing U.S. prosecution of its War on Terror — had earlier made similar complaints but this was the first time a government source had appeared to confirm the story.

This sentence implies that:
 they've been desecrating the Koran all along
 finally, a source more credible than a prisoner came forward

Therefore, the Newsweek story is true - despite its retraction (under government pressure).

I'd like this Wikipedia article to remain scrupulously neutral on the issue of whether the descration story is true.

 Content Dispute 

I'm going to try and mediate the Iranian peoples dispute here could you please post your arguments there and we'll try and come to an reasonable comprimise   

1)Hi, History section needs clarification, while linguistically all of those people are related but it does not mean that ethnically they are all related to eachother, I am pointing to the last paragraph of the history section. It should be clarified. Thanks. Talk + 
 Modern Persians themselves are a diverse group of peoples descended from various Iranian and indigenous peoples of the Iranian plateau including the Elamites. Although all Persians are linguistically connected to each other ethnic backgrounds are diverse with many different cultural traits. 
Would something like that be preferable to you  

Yes, but the word Iranians instead of Persians. Persians are by themselves a member of that linguistic group. Talk + 
 Ok, I stand corrected (I'm not familiar with the topic matter at hand here, I'm googling trying to find information) - if nobody objects I propse changing the paragraph to the above, it seems clearer to me   

No sorry this paragraph: Thus, not unlike the previous example of Germanic peoples involving the English, who are of mixed Germanic and Celtic origin, Iranian is an ethno-linguistic group and the Iranian peoples display varying degrees of common ancestry and/or cultural traits that denote their respective identities.  Talk + 

Here I meant Iranian peoples linguistically are related but it does not mean that ethnically they are all related to eachother. so the claim refering to common ethnicity in the articler is not correct.
 Talk + 
 Ok, is Germanic peoples involving the English, who are of mixed Germanic and Celtic origin also an ethno-linguistic group? If so, should we add """"only"""" to Iranian is an ethno-linguistic group and the Iranian peoples display varying degrees of common ancestry and/or cultural traits that denote their respective identities
  

The Iranian people Unlike gernmanic people are from quite different etnicities like Turkic, Persian and others uncertain. The whole sentence is wrong and POV. we should drop the word common ethnicity and clarify that it is only a linguistic term'''. Talk + 

2)The info box does not belong here. Iranian peoples are not an ethnic group. They are several different ethnicities speaking different languages. It should be removed as in any other linguistic group. Talk + 
 I think you have a valid point there, I would like to see the argument to the contrary before making a recomendation though.

3)Aryan is a linguistic term that refers to an ancient language group that was ancestral to the Indo-European family of languages''. [http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring01/Millig"

You're conflating issues here. This is not an assumption of bad faith; it's adhering to what the source actually says. William M. Connolley's extemporaneous comments here are not a source; the publication (RealClimate) is the source.

This is just a frank evaluation of what the source says; RealClimate says nothing about who worked on the article or how it was written, but we know that unsigned """"group"""" pieces are often not equivalent to joint authorship. For another analogy, consider per curium legal opinions. """"Per curium"""" means that all of the judges or justices agreed, but it's a very different thing from all of them signing the opinion. Typically, they're less controversial cases, so one judge's clerk writes the opinion, then they're circulated for comment. But the other judges typically don't scrutinize it as closely as if their name was on the line; there are many examples of judges railing against dicta that they theoretically endorsed just a couple of years earlier—sometimes even within the same case. Unanimous opinions (where every judge signs) are different, and they reflect a higher level of collaboration, as in Brown v. Board of Education. 

The bottom line is that the source itself doesn't say who wrote it. The commentators on BLP/N seem to think this is an important distinction.  Luke """

[edit] BiographyCuban was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania[6][7] and grew up in the Pittsburgh suburb of Mt. Lebanon, in a Jewish[8] working-class family. His last name was shortened from """"Chabenisky"""" when his Russian grandparents landed on Ellis Island.[9] Cuban's father Norton was an automobile upholsterer.[6][10][11] Cuban's first step into the business world occurred at age 12, when he sold garbage bags to pay for a pair of expensive basketball shoes.[6][12] While in school, he held a variety of jobs, including bartender, disco dancing instructor, and party promoter. He paid for college by collecting and selling stamps, and once gained about $1,100 from starting a chain letter.[6]

Rather than attending high school for his senior year, Cuban enrolled as a full time student at the University of Pittsburgh. After one year at the University of Pittsburgh, he transferred to Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana and graduated in 1981 with a bachelor's degree in business administration.[13]

[edit] FamilyIn September 2002, Cuban married Tiffany Stewart, an advertising executive, in Barbados,[14] with a wedding reception at the American Airlines Center. Their first daughter, Alexis Sofia, was born on September 25, 2005; their second daughter, Alyssa, was born in 2007.[15] Tiffany and Mark also have a son born in early 2010.[2] The family lives in the Preston Hollow area of Dallas, in a 24,000-square-foot (2,200 m2) mansion.[16]

[edit] Early careerIn 1982, Cuban moved to Dallas, Texas. Cuban first found work as a bartender,[17][18] then as a salesperson for Your Business Software, one of the first PC software retailers in Dallas. He was terminated less than a year later, after meeting with a client to procure new business instead of opening the store.[19]

Cuban started a company, MicroSolutions, with support from his previous customers from Your Business Software. MicroSolutions was initially a system integrator and software reseller. The company was an early proponent of technologies such as Carbon Copy, Lotus Notes, and CompuServe.[20] One of the company's largest clients was Perot Systems.[21] In 1990, Cuban sold MicroSolutions to CompuServe—then a subsidiary of H&R; Block—for $6 million.[22] He retained approximately $2 million after taxes on the deal.[23]

In 1995, Cuban and fellow Indiana University alumnus Todd Wagner started Audionet, combining their mutual interest in college basketball and webcasting. With a single server and an ISDN line,[24] Audionet became Broadcast.com in 1998. By 1999, Broadcast.com had grown to 330 employees and $13.5 million in revenue for the second quarter.[25] In 1999, during the dot com boom, Broadcast.com was acquired by Yahoo! for $5.9 billion in Yahoo! stock.[26]

[edit] Business careerAfter the sale of Broadcast.com, Cuban diversified his wealth to avoid exposure to a market crash.[27] As of 2011, Cuban is No. 459 on Forbes' list of """"World's Richest People"""", with a net worth of $2.5 billion.[28] The Guinness Book of Records credits Cuban with the """"largest single e-commerce transaction"""", after he paid $40"

Gibraltar self-government

Dear Justin, I can't understand why you delete my edits on the Gibraltar article and then post the following comment in my page: """"You currently appear to be engaged in an edit war according to the reverts you have made on Gibraltar."""" I have not intended to start an edit war, just eliminated a reference that seems controversial and was not supported by any reference (1) and repositioned some uncontroverted facts (2):

1) The article began with the expression """"Gibraltar (...) is a self-governing British overseas territory (...)"""". This was not supported by any objective reference in the article and, in fact, it is something not endorsed by the UN (see below), which at least provides some ground for not accepting the self-government of Gibraltar as a self-evident fact. Therefore, I substituted it for some referenced facts.

2) The article referenced the fact that Gibraltar is on the UN's non self-governing territories list but British and Gibraltarian polititians think that it should be removed. Only it was lost somewhere in the middle of this (long) article. I repositioned this information to the introduction of the article where it summarises the territory's political nature. It does not matter if 50 years ago it was the UK who nominated Gibraltar for the list: this status is reviewed every year and has not yet been reverted by UN's Special Committee.

What surprises me is: I would have expected that if you disagree with my edits, you would discuss them or, if you think they do not offer a holistic view, you complete them with additional referenced facts. Instead of that, you just deleted the edits and accused me of edit warring.

I will appreciate your discussing the changes and contributing with additional insight and referenced facts. Please do not merely undo my edits.

Kind regards.  

If you want to discuss this the appropriate place is the talk page of the article, not here as this is not a matter between you and justin.  The reality is that since the 2006 constitution Gibraltar is manifestly self governing, sadly progress on delisting it by the UN C24 is hampered by Spain's foolish attitude and intransigence.  It is amusing that that committee is comprised of representatives of states with less democracy than Gibraltar and if you follow the proceedings they have been singularly useless in achieving anything in relation to their remit on ANY territory such that the GoG declined to attend further meetings.  In relation to the politics of Gibralar, which is what the article is about, the UN is irrelevent - indeed the committee has not even visited the territory in question despite being invited to do so by the GoG and the UK. They are not so much a paper tiger as a limp piece of used bog roll.   

Please do not insult my intelligence that your intentions were anything other than to push a POV with that edit.  The facts remain that Gibraltar is self-governing.  It is only Spain that for its own political agenda denies this and the UN C24 is discussed in the article.  Your POV edit sought to give those facts WP:UNDUE prominence.  Your behaviour was also to edit war to keep that edit, hence my warning was appropriate.  And as Gibnews points out the correct place for that discussion was the article talk page. '''' talk """

If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.

If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL.

0,"Thanks heah. This is helpful.

Something to consider, is that the references you pointed to – which are part of a larger list  are very old and are based on work done in the early years of AIDS; also, that subsequent research has not supported the same results.

The primary issue when reviewing the studies most often referenced by someone trying to link nitrites to AIDS, or more specifically to Kaposi’s sarcaoma, is that they are very weak in terms of data presented.  The results have not been repeated by other scientists.  In fact, within the list of referenced studies, there are contradictory results both by the same researcher and between different researchers.

The general consensus in the research community, and in the HIV/AIDS community, is that although the much vaunted list of references claiming to link nitrites to HIV/AIDS may look impressive to the untrained eye, they do not support a case for a claim that nitrite use causes HIV infection or Kaposi’s sarcaoma (KS)."

Plato not """"part of the Socratic entourage"""" or """"inner circle""""?
At the beginning of the Plato and Socrates section of the article, someone had said, """"Plato made himself seem as though he were part of the Socratic entourage but never says so explicitly.  ...  In the Apology, Plato distances himself from the inner circle.""""  I believe this involves a misunderstanding of how Plato represents himself in the Apology.  I would not be prepared to say that Plato considered himself """"part of Socrates' entourage"""" or Socrates' """"inner circle""""; but that's only because it's not clear what whoever wrote this part of the article means by """"entourage"""" or """"inner circle"""".  Is it made clear elsewhere in Plato's dialogues who did belong to the """"inner circle""""?  So far as I know, Plato never mentions an """"inner circle"""".  But he certainly portrays himself in the Apology as one of Socrates' young devoted followers, in quite explicit terms in fact.  Given this fact, I think it's simply misleading to suggest that Plato somehow went out of his way to """"distance himself"""" from Socrates or Socrates' devoted followers.  So I've edited this part of the article accordingly, including textual citations.  Comment if you wish.  """

 Apotropaic exposure of female genitalia 

The La Fontaine reference seems to be wrong in several of the quoted authorities, who state it is from La Fontaine's Fables, but the illustration they refer to is from La Fontaine's Nouvelles Contes. The story in question is Le Diable de Papefiguière. The illustration by Charles Eisen was copied to decorate a late 18th century porcelain cup and saucer, which I found illustrated at  (Accessed ) where it is described as follows:

Paris cup and saucer with scenes from La Fontaine's Contes 1785-90Dark blue ground, rich gilding of scrolls, foliage trails and vases. Reserves on the cup and saucer with grisaille scenes, identified in gilt writing on the underside: on the cup """"la jument du compere pierre"""", and on the saucer """"le diable de papefiguiere"""". No marks. Height of cup 6.1 cm, diameter of saucer 12.9 cm. Circa 1785-90.

This cup is of the Sèvres """"gobelet litron"""" shape. Although unmarked, the quality of the gilding indicates one of the top Paris factories at the period, such as the Duc d'Angoulême's (Dihl & Guérhard). The two painted scenes are taken from the 1767 edition of the Contes de La Fontaine, which was pirated from the famous 1762 Fermiers Généraux one, with engravings after drawings by Charles Eisen. Le Diable de Papefiguière is the story of a devil which comes to frighten a village…

The commentators state that the woman exposes herself to fighten the demon, but I think the story is less straightforward. I haven't found an English translation yet, but it seems to me to be a variation of a well-known folk theme in which Satan/devil/demons are tricked by a cunning peasant couple. An English example would be the folk song """"The Devil and the Feathery Wife"""".  | Talk """

In that cartoon, Spidey had the venom custome before, then abandoned it, and the venom came to Eddy Brook.

 The Riflemen's Song at Bennington 

Removed:

However an isolated earlier use of this term relating to the American War of Independence appears in """"The Riflemen's Song at Bennington"""", an old folk song that supposedly goes back to the 1770s.

Which does indeed refer to the 1777 Bennington Battle but there is nothing to date the song, particularly the Red Coat version. Possibly the original lyric was: """"Why come ye hither, stranger? Your mind what madness fills? In our valleys there is danger, And danger on the hills"""" which seems to have become """"Why come ye hither, Redcoats, your mind what madness fills?

 Anti-TKD slant 

I noticed that the article was changed to reflect a pro-foreign-influence slant.  I will eventually attempt to make appropriate edits in increments... edits made.  Comments welcome:  1. Introduction stated that TKD is an amalgamation of Chinese, Japan and Korean art.  While this may be factually true, it's a misleading introduction to TKD as many martial arts, including all forms of Karate, are amalgamations.  It serves no good purpose, other than NPOV agenda, to highlight this as an introduction to TKD.  2. Under """"development of TKD"""", controversies surrounding Karate's influence on TKD was overstated once again.  This topic is dealt with quite accurately in the Karate article.  It makes sense to follow that lead in this case.  It's misleading and NPOV the way it is written now.  3. Under """"traditional roots"""" TKD's foreign influence is again overstated.  Whoever, made these edits obviously had a pro-karate agenda.  The topic of foreign influence can be delt with in a fair and objective manner without being beaten to death under every subsection!  4. Under """"External Influence"""" foreign influence should be appropriately dealt with. 

The article is now overstating Taekwondo's relationship with Subak/Taekkyon; do we really need several long paragraphs all about """"Subak"""" (手搏) (whatever that was) and the Hwarang (whoever they really were) and Taekkyon supposedly slowly developing into Taekwondo over hundreds of years?  Taekkyon still exists today, so we can talk about Taekkyon's development in that article separately (noting that Taekkyon looks completely different from modern Taekwondo).  Japan's influences on Taekwondo are also well-documented, so why remove it?  Let's keep a neutral point of view for this article.  At this point, it sounds like the first few pages of a Taekwondo student's guide.

I think this needs to be looked into more carefully but history of Korean martial arts is a very relevant part of tkd.  Let's leave the text as is until we can sort this out.  I also have to say that your dismissive attitude isn't very POV.  Instead of blindly defending or rejecting labels, we need to deconstruct ideas and arguments and go through them with a fine comb.  Regardless of what you want to call it, Koreans have been kicking in fights and contests for thousands of years and documentation for this exists as far back as the three kingdoms era.  Chosun documentation also exists that show that Subak was part of the formal requirements for entrance into Chosun military and large Taekyon tournaments held by the populace well into the 1800's.  Most of Korean folk arts and traditional Korean disciplines existed and even thrived during the Chosun dynasty without formalization or systemization(e.g. korean wrestling called ssirum, pan sori, musical instruments, minstrels, etc.).  But the absence of formal schools, teachers and formal links doesn't mean that those arts weren't passed down or that they didn't exist.    While tkd isn't taekyon, tkd is a product of Korean attempts at formalizing a Korean martial art.  In an objective inquiry into TKD's origins, you need to understand the history and culture of Korean martial arts, culture and history.  To leave this out would be erroneously simplistic.  The martial arts aspect of Korean culture(folk culture during Chosun times) provides the basis for the formalization and systemization that Korean martial arts goes through in the 1900's.  TKD claims this, history and culture of Korean arts and disciplines provides the background for this, and the actual practice of tkd bears this out.  To ignore all this and look only for and only accept formal links between masters, students, formal schools, etc., is NPOV and more importantly wouldn't reflective objective reality behind TKD's conception.

btw.  There's a lot of crap out there about a lot of Korean martial arts but Hwarang are mentioned in Korean historical documents, Subak is mentioned countless times in military, historical records including Chosun records.  Taekyon was a part of Subak and its popularity was well documented by during Chosun times in its mention of Taekyon tournaments that were held well into the 1800's.   

To keep this (relatively) short, just a few points:

1. We know that """"Subak"""" has been mentioned in the Mooyedobotongji and other sources, but we don't really know exactly what """"Subak"""" actually referred to.  In China, the same word (pronounced """"Shoubo"""") was used as a general term for barehand martial arts, however - thus, it is likely that Koreans used the same word in the same way (as it was a loanword).
2. Hwarang are of course mentioned in many Korean texts, but we don't actually know"

Hi Kbell90, Great article! I love how well organized it is and clear-cut and concise. It flows, its informative, and its not so complicated that you can’t understand. I’d say so far so good.  As for ways to improve on it, I came across a few different points you could consider adding.

The main question that kept popping up for me as I read was how do antiandrogens suppress androgen synthesis?  In the Intro is the first time this mechanism is mentioned and again in the Mechanism section itself, however, it seems a little vague and I was left wondering well…if this is a separate mechanism than blocking the receptor, then how exactly are they suppressing synthesis. It makes sense that blocking the receptor would block androgen effects, but wouldn’t androgen levels accumulate if they aren’t binding their receptors as usual? How do the chemicals diminish these levels? These articles may help:

http://www.d.umn.edu/~jfitzake/Lectures/DMED/Antineoplastics/Antihormones/AntiAndrogenMechanism.html

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor

Also, how do androgens suppress gonadrotrophin in the case of pharmaceuticals? Is this a similar mechanism?

 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6427478

 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8697573

I would be interested in seeing a section on how one can avoid being exposed to these chemicals and to reduce exposure to children during development. Have they found any way to reduce these chemicals in the environment yet?

Here’s a neat article on how effects are amplified when exposure is cumulative…might be good to include a little blurb on this.
 
 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20487045

Is there any current evidence on how release of these chemicals into the environment is  affecting the biodiversity of species and species reproduction?

No you have a biased idea that the be all and end all of baseball cards is those of the United States, which again reflects the almost defalult bias of Wikipedia to be American centred. I spent a lot of time in the UK and my mother is a Mancunian, so I am ever aware of this bias. I am not angry at you, but I am pointing out a fundamental flaw of the article, it is not written in a global context and it is not written for someone who knows little to nothing about baseball cards. 

Of the top of my head, here is what needs to be done
 Have more people giving input on article content, perferably some non-Americans
 Internationalize the article.
 Split off the history of American baseball cards into a Baseball cards in the United States article and have a brief summary of it on the baseball card page

For example, rather than giving the latitude and longitude of a town, it is better to state that it is the suburb of some city, or perhaps that it provides services for the farm country of xyz county.

What if they're just really bad at keeping secrets?  Look, I'm not going to point out a conspiracy theory here.

It makes it seem even more suspicious when they get extremely pissed off for even stepping one inch onto the property outside of where the meeting is being held.  What on earth are they afraid of?

Manchus

In April you reverted my edits with the comment that """"This paragraph was vandalized from previous revisions. It drastically changed from its original source."""".

Whether the changes are justified or not, they were not vandalism as they were explained at the discussion page for Manchus (""""Manchus and political football""""). Before reverting edits on the strength of charges of vandalism, I would be grateful if you could check the talk page and first address arguments made there.

My objection to the statement that """"Much recent scholarship in ethnic identity emphasizes that ethnic categories, rather than being static and objective, are fluid and subjective"""" is the fact that this could apply to ANY ethnic group, and could thus be placed at any article on any ethnic group. Making this specific point only at the article on the Manchus sounds like a rationalisation or excuse. It sounds highly defensive, as though there is no real basis for asserting Manchu ethnic identity other than the over-subtle distinctions of academics. We know that Crossley argued from this point of view, but is it necessary to incorporate this in the article? It's almost as if the article were saying """"We know the Manchus are not considered an ethnic group, but if ethnicities are regarded as fluid and subjective, we can perhaps recognise them as such"""". 

The Qing dynasty was based on an apartheid-like situation where the Chinese and Manchus were kept apart. During the Qing the Manchus retained a consciousness of being a separate ethnic group, even after they mostly switched to speaking Chinese. There are still Manchus today who retain a consciousness of the separateness of Manchu culture, quite apart from the state-sponsored ethnic categories. So my point is, why do we have to bend over backwards to try and justify a viewpoint simply because it is at odds with the current consensus? Is there a need to be so pointedly defensive just in the case of the Manchus?

 Reply to your question 

I'm curious as to why you (Mister Hospodar) conclude that everyone who disagrees with you (that is, everyone you've encountered on Wikipedia thus far) must be part of a nefarious conspiracy, and why they must be """"paid"""" by their """"bosses"""" to """"police"""" these articles. Leaving aside the various behavioral policies violated by such repetitive accusations, do you think alternate explanations are possible, if not likely? For example, is it possible that people edit these articles out of a desire to create a serious, respectable reference work - one that treats discredited claims honestly as discredited claims, rather creating a false impression of ongoing scientific debate? Could these nefarious editors possibly be motivated to contribute their free time to ensure that potentially important medical information here accurately reflects the knowledge of scholars and experts in the field? MastCell Talk 

In reply to the above question, I will state that NO, there is no other possible explanation for editors who take down within 30 minutes any edits that disagree with their agenda without considering the logic or validity of these edits, many of which edits greatly improve the articles in question; whose arguments funnel always into the same tired arguments and bullying, all of which adhere to a fixed political agenda and specific types of censorship; who are on call seemingly 24 hours a day for years to revert any edit which they think is damning to their agenda; who spend countless hours creating specious, illogical arguments and trying the time-worn tactic of  invalidating their """"opponents"""" with name-calling and fringe accusations; who ridicule and demean everyone, including established scientists, who disagree with their agenda; who are clearly not clever or informed enough to be operating on their own, say, as AIDS scientists or researchers who merely want to help the world with their knowledge; and who police a number of pages all related to the concerns of pharmaceutical companies, slamming alternative therapies and spreading disinformation about diseases.

If you want detail about why it is historically nonsense: York and Lancaster were branches of the house of Plantagenet, competing with each other but not with some independent """"Plantagenet"""" faction. The house of Tudor was descended (maternally) from a branch of the Lancasters, who did not survive the wars. The first Tudor King, Henry VII, came to the throne by winning the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, which was Tudor vs. York. The next year he married Elizabeth of York which helped legitimise his claim to the throne; but any tensions in the next few years were Tudor vs. York, not Tudor and York vs. """"Plantagenet assemblies.""""
Research: I read the articles Plantagenet, Tudor dynasty, Battle of Bosworth, Henry VII of England, Elizabeth of York, checked the links  and a few on-line sources about Norton Canes, and off-line checked A.R.Myers, England in the Late Middle Ages, p.185, which lists risings and disturbances from 1486 to 1497 but does not mention this, and C.

Section 1b of the GACR states, """"it complies with the manual of style guidelines for lead sections, layout, words to watch, fiction, and list incorporation.""""

It begins """"For how to generate and format these sections, see Help:Footnotes and Wikipedia:Citing sources"""" Wikipedia:Citing sources aka WP:REF includes section 6.1 Variation in citation methods aka WP:CITEVAR. Extracted guidlelines of note from sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.2:

To be avoided
 Switching between major citation styles, e.g., switching between parenthetical and  tags or between the style preferred by one academic discipline vs. another

Generally considered helpful
 Imposing one style on an article with incompatible citation styles (e.g., some of the citations in footnotes and others as parenthetical references): an improvement because it makes the formatting consistent

By following GA-criteria I am led, with no uncertainty, to a sound conclusion and made the reasonable request that all references be made consistent. They are currently a mixed bag of s and . Per WP:CITEVAR this is avoidable and unhelpful, and therefore unacceptable, in my opinion it fails the GAN requirement to follow MOS:LAYOUT closely enough. I will be failing this part of the GA nomination should the article remain a mixed bag, per WP:GACR which is built upon consensus that affects ALL of wikipedia and ALL GA nominations.

 The Red Bedroom 

Lucky 6.9,
I noticed that you've speedied this (and one other) album while at the same time placing a brief comment on the user page.

Do you think that this was the best course of action?  I'd ask you to compare the message I left with yours, and also ask that you restore these stubs.  We want to encourage people to write good stubs, don't we?  Deleting it outright doesn't do that.

(t)(c) 

This came out bitchier than I intended, sorry.  With the """"no artist"""" stubs (which drive me crazy) I usually find that the person who created them edits the artist's page just before or after, and often add the link in myself.  Thanks for restoring those, (t)(c) 

 Please 

Referring to the RfA nomination.   (talk)  

 THANK YOU SO MUCH 

For nominating me on RfA.  Have this beautiful jewel for my thank you.

Take care,   (talk)  

BTW, something went wrong.  Wikipedia:Requests_for_admminship/V._Molotov needs to be moved to fix the typo, but it can't be moved because there's an article in the way.  Looks like someone needs to delete Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/V._Molotov and then do the move.   (talk) 

 Your message 

Hi, you left this message on my talk page:
Thanks for experimenting with Wikipedia. Your test worked, and has been reverted. Please use the sandbox for any other tests you want to do. Take a look at the welcome page if you would like to learn more about contributing to our encyclopedia. Thanks. - Lucky 6.9 

It's difficult to tell whether you are being sarcastic or are mistaken. What experiment? I cannot find any edits or original articles of mine that you have reverted.

Regards,
 

It's a shame you felt it necessary to revert as """"experimentation"""" what was obviously an article (albeit a stub). As you will see from my history, I am new to Wikipedia but have enjoyed creating and editing a number of articles about some fairly hefty topics. It occurred to me that someone who enjoys wikipedia (such as myself) ought to be referred to as a wikipedophile. A google search reveals no fewer than 132 instances of the word on the net. If other neologisms such as """"leet"""" are to have articles, why not this one? Why not at least leave the article there for others to discuss rather than annihilating it unilaterally?

 

So, you deleted my article because you decided not enough people would be interested in it? That's as good an argument for keeping the article: nobody interested, nobody sees it; someone interested, someone finds it. No harm done. QED. Ah, but in that case, no self-aggrandising administrator satisfaction, and no opportunity to post supercilious mesages about the sandbox. It is easier to destroy than to create. Enjoy.  

OK, I will leave the subject - it is hardly a fair argument when one of us has the power to silence the other on a whim - but as an admin you will perhaps wish to know that you have discouraged me from contributing further to Wikipedia. My brief edit history will show me a valuable contributor, and I had been inspired by the """"be bold in editing"""" tenet of Wikipedia. Alas, this spirit is evidently mired in the usual unaccountable, pseudopolitical hierarchies, fiefdoms and cliques that invariably beleaguer such online efforts. Adieu.  

The neologism is far from the point. I am reluctant to contribut"

The short answer is: no. The tow maneuvers look almost identical from outside the cockpit, but from inside it is clear that there is a very distinct difference. In an aileron roll, you pull up on the stick and then push it forward again (going back o a neutral position), and then roll with the ailerons using no elevator. It's the aerial version of """"popping a wheelie."""" 

In a slow roll, you may be rolling as fast as possible or you may take a full ten minutes to roll the plane. In this case, you have to use both rudder and elevator during the roll to keep on course, or else you'll find yourself in a nose die towards the ground. An aileron roll is fairly easy for a beginner, but a slow roll takes a great amount of practice even for an expert. An aileron roll is clumsy an uncoordinated, but extremely fun, while a slow roll is precise and difficult. An aileron roll will also keep the g-force positive, while a slow roll turns you all around like clothes in a dryer.   """

 Ban 

The reality of the matter is that every time Varsovian returned to wikipedia he inserted himself /invented a new dispute. You accuse me of nationalistic """"persistent POV-pushing pursuit"""", where exactly have I done that, eh? What a joke, you just made that up to justify your ban. Jaroslaw Bilaniuk, Jakiw Palij and Bohdan Koziy are simply not Poles, if somebody tries to add the category """"Polish Nazi Collaborator"""" then he is simply trying to insert untrue information which needs to be removed. It's as simple as that. Did you care to check if there are any sources calling these guys """"Polish Nazi Collaborators"""" or is that falls outside your intellectual capabilities? How is removing wrong information """"persistent POV-pushing pursuit""""!?

I am a member of 3 Wiki Projects, I worked on many different topic areas and improved countless pages, I have created 200 new articles, and a couple DYKs as well. And what exactly has Varsovian contributed to wikipedia apart from constantly creating disputes on Polish topics? Are you able to name one single page on which Varsovian did some substantial work worthy of mention in one year of """"activity"""" on Wikipedia? I don't ask 30 or 40 pages but ONE single page. 

Your systematic attempts at trying to equal me with Varsovian are both shameful and disgraceful, but I am not surprised. One can easily guess the morals of a person who blocked me for 72 hours after I simply and politely asked if I am allowed to do something. Or person who first refuses to do AE because there is lack of transparency and a problem with notification (good one that one) and then comes back a couple of hours later to do a revenge AE nobody requested.

I am confused here.  I posted something about both of the publically funded Waldorf schools in Sonoma County, not an 'individual school,' and that information comes from official sources (so it is properly sourced), and the information provides information which contradicts the 'Official' Waldorf position.  I do not believe that the 'official' statement of the Waldorf committee reflects their reality.  Anti-immunization is so highly correlated with the Waldorf schools I have looked at as to be close to official policy.  Waldorf schools in the US  education as practiced in the US includes a substantial anti-immunization    

 Concerns over immunizations 

The current text refers to a 'consensus statement' which is a dead link.  This page http://www.waldorfanswers.org/QuestionsMore.htm refers to a growing anti-immunization movement within and outside of Waldorf schools, but again refers to the same dead link as the 'consensus statement' on vaccinations.

The article does not cite a verifiable source on the policy of Waldorf education towards vaccinations.  The article does say """"Studies have found Waldorf pupils to have a lower incidence of allergies and allergic-like symptoms, an effect which correlated with the extent to which they lived an """"anthroposophic lifestyle"""" generally - in particular with reduced use of antibiotics, antipyretics, and measles, mumps and rubella vaccination""""  Which is a deep violation of NPOV - to assert a correlation when there is a deep selection bias in the cited studies.

Thanks Nadiatalent, your comments are helpful and I've made another try at the Social issues text below, adding in new references for the first paragraph and placing the reference for Indonesia at the end of the second paragraph (an oversight on my part before). In this second try I have also made some changes to the wording of the first paragraph so that it is accurate to the references.

The new references for the first paragraph are studies on Malaysia and Indonesia. I'll provide quotes here so that you can see what they say about palm oil production's social impact:

1. Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of Palm Oil Production: 
""""The data showed generally positive financial and socio-economic consequences of oil palm adoption in the immediate surroundings of oil palm estates.""""
""""In terms of industry and economic opportunities, OPCs [oil palm communities] feature more wood-based industries, and a higher numbers of shops, minimarkets and hotels.""""

2, The local impacts of oil palm expansion in Malaysia: 
""""According to respondents, the primary reasons for shifting from traditional livelihood activities to oil palm cultivation were higher returns for oil palm due to perceived high prices (43.3%) and perceived ease of managing oil palm plantations (30%).""""
""""Generally, oil palm has brought positive impacts, such as increased income, secure employment, and improved access to social services. However, involvement in oil palm has also caused many local communities to move away from traditional practices.""""
See also the table of results on page 11 which lists """"Increased income"""", """"More steady or reliable income"""", """"Education"""", """"Better access to transport services"""", """"Health facilities"""", """"Accommodation"""" as survey respondents' perceived benefits of palm oil production.

For the point about landholders being able to participate in the cash economy, I think the existing reference works. Here is the quote:

""""...the authority has set up a number of joint ventures with NCR [native customary rights] landholders. Under these agreements, local title-holders are paid a dividend, ensuring that part of the profits flow back into the community.""""

Oil palm is a valuable economic crop and provides a source of employment. It allows small landholders to participate in the cash economy and often results in improvements to local infrastructure and greater access to services such as schools and health facilities. In some areas, the cultivation of oil palm has replaced traditional practices, often due to the higher income potential of palm oil.

However, in some cases, land has been developed by oil palm plantations without consultation or compensation of the indigenous people occupying the land. This has occurred in Papua New Guinea, Colombia, and Indonesia. In the Sarawak state of Malaysian Borneo, there has been debate over whether there was an appropriate level of consultation with the Long Teran Kanan community prior to the develo"

Bigfoot

Welcome back. Like the Devil and Daniel Webster. True, the intro is a mess and it must be made clear that Bigfoot is not a proven zoological species, but is tentative, and unproven.

This has not yet been stated. It needs to be. Skeptical editors can relax and know that skeptics are correct, there is no zoological Bigfoot nor Yeti. But there is something else.

And of course there have been many dozens, if not hundreds of symmetrical building collapses outside 9/11, all of them due to controlled demolition.  There are zero examples of symmetrical collapse from fires, impact damage, or anything besides contolled demolition.  Achieving symmetry in a building collapse requires that all of the vertical supports fail at the same time, or a least fail in an evenly spaced, symmetrical manner. The odds of this happening by chance are very small, especially considering the impact damage and fires were asymmetrical. For it to happen three times in one day is profoundly significant, statistically speaking."

I believe that a avid Wikipedia editor like yourself would feel more obligated to find correct sources to back of questionable information than outright delete information that could be potentially correct but ill sourced.

0,"Importing Module:Convert 

At my test2 talk (last September), you mentioned that there is currently no way to import a page from test2 to here, but that in principle test2 could be added as an import source (diff of your comment).

My reading of Help:Import shows that I do not have the rights to do an import, even if it were possible. Also, it seems unlikely that test2 would be added because import looks like a big deal (although something specifically for importing modules conceivably could be done, and no doubt someone like  could import stuff if required.

There's no rush, and we'll see what takes place when Scribunto is enabled in a day or two, but I would like to import Module:Convert and Module:Convertdata to here for easier comparison with the existing templates. My current intention is to create the modules here with a copy/paste and a suitable edit summary including a link to the source (I would do that after the Module namespace is created here).

The next issue would be to create a template to invoke the module. Obviously it won't be Template:Convert. I could do a user subpage then test with something like {{User Johnuniq:convert|...}}, but that is klunky, and would be unsuitable in an article if I get bold enough to see how it goes in an article with some convert templates. Another possibility would be to create a standard template, something like [[Template:Xconvert]] or [[Template:convertz]] ( exists).

Do you have any thoughts about the copy/paste or template?"

Jesus Bloodline is to be linked to """"esoteric Christianity"""" it needs to be emphasised that it is to an untraditional and modern version of """"esoteric Christianity"""" that has been influenced by Margaret Starbird. And this can be easily done. There are ample internet sites that define traditionalist esoteric Christianity and this needs to be compared against the esoteric Christianity that was inspired by Margaret Starbird. Traditional esoteric Christianity that dates historically back thousands of years to Origen of Alexandria dealt with metaphysical matters. The common interpretation of Gnosticism widely held by maistream scholarship is that it was a dualist nature holding that matter was evil and rejecting the physical substance of Christ. This can be easily substantuated by reliable and independent sources from works published by mainstream scholars. It was the book Holy Blood and Holy Grail that was first responsible for twisting the idea that Gnosticism """"believed that Jesus Christ was a human being"""", and this became uncritically repeated ever since by those who uncritically follow the modern concept of the Jesus Bloodline. Again, it can be very easily verified by citing scholarly books that the Jesus Christ of Gnosticism was not a physical human being.

Then when you've established your credibility, try re-organising existing material - amalgamate material that deals with the same subject but might appear in different sections, shorten paragraphs and improve syntax, and so on - but always trying not to delete more than is essential, and trying also to retain wikilinks.

If you will allow me to creating Mob Related Articles, I'll be out of your hair. Let's be positive about this, and give me another chance to reedem myself. 

  

I have blocked this self-confessed sock, and in view of the repeated socking upgraded the master account to indef. This person really doesn't get it and will IMO have to make a convincing request to be allowed back in.   

And Genovese, you can't say you follow all rules, then break them by creating new accounts over and over.  That is breaking the rules itself, and causing a lot of work for others to clean up.  Maybe you would be better finding a different hobby other than Wikipedia.   - 2¢  ©  Join WER

Lordkazan, I am currently looking for suitable citations. But still, I feel my original point was intentionally overlooked. You see, recently, I edited a German article concerning a Neonazi brand name (de:Consdaple). In that article, I inserted totally """"biased"""" ridiculing phrases, because I felt that in Germany, it is always better to decidedly distance yourself from Nazism (and because I am rather convinced of my eloquence in German, although I am certainly not as godlike at it as Avi is with English). Now, with the circumcision article, I have a similar dilemma. But my POV here is, although not more biased than with the Nazi topic, not the Public POV. And that's what I meant in the circumcision discussion: My POV is that there is no NPOV besides the instantaneous total rejection of neonatal genital mutilation, be it in Jewish tradition or whatever. And all that pointing to the respective guidelines by Avi or Jakew won't change that. But the article does not even feature the word """"intact"""", which in itself (the word and its rejection by the pro-biased lobby) is sufficient proof to me that they will never cease to bombard common sense. So alright, I'm Sancho Pansa, but do you really believe in playing the game like this? After all, Jakew doesn't have a problem with the Wikipedia guidelines, because his personal bias is similar to the American/community bias on the topic of circumcision.  """

Re: the """"KKK"""" connection.  

As I recall, Napier forms a rebel group known as the """"Soldiers of Liberty,"""" but to maintain their cover, they only speak the initials of the organization.  I don't recall if we're told the Amtorian word for """"soldier,"""" but we do know that in their universal language, plurals are formed by adding a prefix, either """"kloo-"""" or """"kl-"""" depending upon whether the root word begins with a consonant or a vowel.  We do learn that the Amtorian for """"of"""" is """"kum.""""  Therefore, """"liberty"""" must either be a plural concept, or must begin with a """"k"""" anyawy.  So, the group is named the """"Kl-something kum K-something,"""" initials K-K-K!  We're told that's spoken kung-kung-kung on Venus rather than kay-kay-kay, by the kay ... er, way.

Wait a minute, on this basis, wouldn't just about every Amtorian organization have at least two K's in their initials? Wouldn't the K-K-K get confused with the K-K-P and the K-K-S-K and all the others.?  Hell of a way to carry on covert operations.  Sounds like that Monty Python bit about the Judean People's Front versus the People's Front of Judea and the other splitters.  (""""What!  You're from the kung-kung-kung!  How dare you?""""  """"No, I said kung-kung-bung!"""")

Ergo, it would be pretty stupid to use actual initials given a language that uses kl- before every plural noun.  

Such a language ought to sound pretty awful, and to initiate choking in the speaker whenever a long passage is spoken, but never mind.  If a language expert like Tolkein had pulled something like this, you might infer a sinister motivation, but Burroughs never let logic get in the way of entertainment, and this served him and his readers quite well.

Napier smiles in amusement when his organization is rendered as K-K-K. Given my explanation, he should have laughed out loud.  That's hardly a political endorsement. Pursuing that track is S.O.L., and that ain't Soldiers of Liberty.   05:46, 3 August 2010 (UTC"""

0,"Jesse Ragan deletion nomination
Hi, I have received notice that the page I began about Jesse Ragan has been nominated for deletion based upon suspicion it is a vanity article. First, I am not the man (assuming Jesse ragan is male), nor have I met him/her. I began the article because as a professor of typography I felt Ragan's work significant, and that s/he had achieved work of lasting merit fairly early in life. S/he has been several time recognized by the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) (the national professional organization for graphic designers), Ragan's work has appeared in respected design periodicals, and has lectured on typography at several Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD) institutions. 

Several days ago I noticed removal of Ragan's name from credits for typefaces on the Tobias Frere-Jones article. My first thought was that some disagrement might have occured between Ragan and his former employers Hoefler & Frere-Jones, perhaps leading to a nomination for deletion. Mr. Hoefler wrote to me publicly on my talk page that Jesse Ragan was only one of many who worked on the project. That may be the case, but that would not discredit typefaces Ragan has produced entirely on his own, or the two mentions of his contributions to the Archer typeface on the AIGA web site. Clearly, at some point someone at Hoefler & Frere-Jones thought Ragan's contributions significant enough to provide his/her name (and not the rest of that team) to our national professional organization. The fact that Mr./Ms. Ragan is now independent and a competitor to other type foundries might be a part of this. But I have no knowledge of this. I know none of these people personally, and I respect the work of all of them as a review of my edit history will suggest. My primary reason for beginning the article was to increase the number of articles on typeface designers, and a secondary desire to increase the number of typography related articles in general. Jesse Ragan's work is very solid, even his/her own direct client list is impressive. In the world of typography, apprentices are historically given credit, witness Francesco Griffo who apprenticed to Aldus Manutius. It is my hope that Wikipedia will continue to make some room for subjects that though not block buster in scale are significant."

Thank you for posting a message on my talk page. The comment I made was not in regard to the content of your edits or your sense of persecution. At the moment in question, you had appeared to have made four successive reversions of the Spain article. I posted a message on your talk page to draw your attention to WP:3RR. The wording of the message is from a standard template. I posted the message to draw your attention to the rule. It was a warning, and if you had reverted the article again while I was still logged on, I would have blocked you for 24h: I'm glad that I didn't have to. This is in complete accord with WP policy. My stance does not reflect any viewpoint on the content of your edits: 3RR is there to stop an article being filled with angry reverts. You should be careful not to get angry as you edit WP, and to remain civil. Otherwise, it becomes far too easy fo things to get out of control. Ecemaml has posted a remark further down the page, and I shall inform them that you feel persecuted, and suggest that they don't go looking for a fight.

I would just like to point something out.  As a long practicing Wiccan, I was incredibly offended by the remarks of the obviously Christian person several posts above who makes the claim that witchcraft comes from the devil.  One of the most basic rules to Wicca is """"to give evil a name is to give it power"""".  Therefore, true Wiccans do not believe in a devil or a hell that bad people are sent to.  To explain the idea of afterlife that we believe in would take up quite a bit of space, and I am not trying to sway anyone to my beliefs.  I respect all religions and all people, and I do have an open mind to new people and beliefs.  However, my mind is not so open that my brain is going to fall out.  I have been persecuted for my unorthodox beliefs, losing friends over it because I did not want to convert to their religion.  Eshmasesh, I agree with you completely, however, there is not a set number of deities to worship in modern Wicca.  The God and the Goddess are very important, but there is also the All (or Spirit).  Worshipping nature is a common facet of many Wiccan branches in modern times, as is the belief that true balance can only be achieved by nature.  As for the multiple deities, Wicca is a polytheistic religion, and there are many branches to choose from.  In branches such as Khemetic (Egyptian Wicca) and Alexandrian (Greek) Wicca, you can devote an entire ritual to one specific God, like Aphrodite or Horus, or encompass several.  The choice is entirely up to the worshipper.  I know that there are teenagers who dress in all black and lots of jewelry and proclaim themselves to be witches, but they are nothing of the sort.  This is not saying that witches don't dress in black and wear jewelry, some may.  But Wicca as a religion, not a fad, requires hard work and dedication.  I look forward to the day that Wicca and all Pagan religions are as widely accepted as Christianity, but I am not holding my breath.  I just ask that Christians try to practice open-mindedness as much as they preach it.  The world would be a better place if more people were open-minded.

   Wiccan Woman, December 23, 2006  (Happy Yule to all the Wiccans, and Merry Christmas to all the Christians!)"""

I have never used swear words against him but have used descroiptions that are accurate. look at his recent self serving post on rod laver to carlo and his digraceful censorship of my legitimate  comments; he is not a censor or a dictator ' but acts like one; he needs to be brought to heel and your helping him because  your  stopping crticism of him. he is an absoloute disgrace. plenty of people have criticied him but he never, never apologises. its beyond a joke. its war as far as l'm concerned and its being going on for 5 months mate and is not going to stop  until he is broughy to book.

Yeah, this is pretty much how I see you. I can tell the difference between an editor or admin """"out to get me,"""" a few are on occasion, maybe, and one who is simply dealing with matters as they appear at the moment. Often what I do can be hard to understand; if I'm brief, it's rejected as incoherent, if I explain thoroughly, it's tl;dr. And to explain with the exact balance of brevity and detail is difficult and often time-consuming; that is the best of writing, and it's hard to come by. One of my friends who, in the past, has written on the same topics as I do, but who is far more brief, has said that, sure, he's brief, but I'm more thorough, and it takes him three times as long to write his brief summary (which, I'd say, is typically excellent) as it takes me to write my tome.) Ideally, it takes all kinds to write and edit an encyclopedia; writers *often* are too wordy, besides having points of view, making mistakes, and failing to reference claims, because they are writing from personal knowledge, and that's why they need editors, in real life as well as on Wikipedia. Editors and writers, real-world, are famous for conflict.
On-line interaction is also famous for leading to flame wars, because of the absence of all the cues that allow truly high-bandwidth communication in person, mostly visual: this can't be stuffed into the very narrow channel of text, not even close (much more than a thousand times as much information per second). I've been """"conferencing"""" on-line since the mid-1980s, and it was obvious then. If there is rapport failure, text may be interpreted through a hostile filter; hostile or false meanings can be seen in the text, instead of alternate true or at least neutral meanings. Woonpton has done some reading in my history, and doesn't understand what she read (I think it's she). Others have done the same. If you look at Jehochman's warning to me that was the basis for my block last year, you could see a similarity with Woonpton's conclusions. Iridescent didn't make that the basis of the block, but was clearly thinking the like of it in discussions around the block on her Talk page. I went to the trouble of working it out with Jehochman, first with a userspace self-RfC (an new process, I must say, that should be more used by editors with a complaint about how they have been treated, it was designed to be minimally disruptive; had I been as accused, I'd have been so advised, and I would not have been able to use the self-RfC for anything else), then by approaching Jehochman directly, and, out of that, a very solid working relationship has been formed. it was good even before we met in person. I never did address it with Iridescent, it seemed moot by the time I'd have been ready. Maybe someday. Thanks for dropping by, make yourself at home.

 Traditional or Simplified Chinese? 

I've moved this to a new section because it has become difficult to continue two topics in the same section. I would like to discuss what should be done about the issue of Traditional and Simplified Chinese in TW related articles (without discussing romanisation methods). My aim is just to get a consensus (either way), and not simply to push my ideas on wiki. I have tried posting similar topics in the HK page as well as the manual of style, but it seems hard to have an active discussion let alone get any real consensus. 

Why are we still including both sets in these articles?

Naturally I support removing simplified Chinese from TW related articles. It is just as misleading to include traditional chinese in the PRC article as it is to include simplified chinese in the ROC article. I am not talking about matters of race or cultural identity, but about de facto usage. Users in the pinyin section have argued (quite well) that hanyu pinyin should be included in ROC articles because it is used de facto, even in TW. So why then can't we eliminate simplified chinese from the TW related articles as TW's de facto standard is traditional chinese only? Wiki is not a chinese dictionary, so is there any reason to include TW and PRC's writing systems in the articles of the other? This doesn't have anything to do with anyone's personal views on """"one china"""" or """"two chinas"""", but rather is an issue of reflecting the language situation in both areas and cleaning up articles.

Chances are they are also a cult group, or even a ghost religion (one that exists only in the Internet).

If you remove all the Bereans references in the Ang Dating Daan article and replace them all with citation needed tags, we can probably remove all of those unsourced statements within a month's time.

It is pretty much default procedure for editors to place a comments and criticisms section in articles, particularly regardind articles about corporations. I think Cailil's abuse of admin power is apparent in this case. The fact that he threatens to tag anyone who replaces the comments and criticisms section as a vandal is obvious, and can be seen as an abuse of admin power, voting is the generally accepted way of resolving these disputes yet he has completely ignored this and used his admin power to forward his personal agenda surrouding this article. This here is exactly what is wrong with wikipedia. Admin abuse is about the only flaw in the open source concept and project that is wikipedia. More often admins are seen as using their powers to strike back for bruised egos, or protection of their NON-neutral point of view. Wikipedia is flat out an open source project, and while the Policies are generally adhered to, even Jimmy Wales has left stuff alone when the community demanded it, no matter if it adhered to the policies.

CMY (witholding K for the moment) is factually a 3-dimensional model.

This is the mathematical view and is not misleading. It does not include the non-linearity of ink combination, which of course should also be treated in the article.
 For visualizing a space-filling entity a picture is worth a thousand words, not least for the inexperienced reader. Flat drawings of 3-D objects in perspective are not universally recognizable and here we have the additional challenge of seeing through a filled volume. Please propose any better way.

You give reasons 1 to 4 for adding black ink all of which I agree should be in the article. The animation could omit black and I did look at that.

That is baloney.   That statement reflects pure bias.   You can go count the number of rebates on TigerDirect.com and you'll find less there than you find on Amazon or Newegg or any of TigerDirect.com's other competitors.   Regarding the attorney general's complaint, you also have to note that in response to the complaint Tigerdirect argued that it's not true.   If you want to state that a company has used rebates in its marketing and has had public complaints about the fulfillment of those rebates then you can create a blanket statement and apply it to pretty much every computer and CE reseller in the country.

What is clear is that a whole bunch of editors have a hard on for TigerDirect.  Those who cry about others POVs and bias are usually the same ones who will stop at nothing to spread their ownwell-disguised under the heading of """"facts""""

Mick I think knows this subject more than I do, although I am more or less one of the major (at least frequent, anyway) editors relating to religion and Christianity. Also, in some of his statements, like his accepting the """"Apocalypse of John,"""" is is clear that he definitely qualifies as """"former"""". There are also a variety of Jewish Christian groups, although there is no evidence Dylan belonged to a group that has been described as such. This subject has been extensively discussed before, and in fact led to an editor being banned at one point. He did achieve a great deal of press coverage, and thus notability, for the albums he issued during his """"Christian"""" period, and it is seems on that basis that his """"Christianity"""" be noted. As he has never conclusively subsequently officially renounced any form of Christianity, there is a good chance WP:BLP might enter into our moving him into Category:Former Christians or anything like that, because he has never himself that I know of described himself unequivocally in such terms. In short, this is still a matter of some ambiguity about the subject, particularly taking BLP into account, and I think the current categorization schema was arrived at after those really lengthy, and frankly extremely contentious, discussions. And we really don't have a category of Category:People who have been described as both Jewish and Christian, so this seems to be, basically, the only way to go. Some sort of FAQ template at the top of the page might be useful here, but, in general, I think Mick is among the most productive editors on this article, and I trust his conclusions based on the amount of material he has personally reviewed and his conclusions.

Greetings,
I have seen your name everywhere already. Thanks for your recent attention to WP:PHILO and the aesthetics dept. I had recently been working on the logic project. I did quite a bit of work on it, and then ran up against some cultural issues.

I wanted to get User:SatyrBot (an apparently wonderful service!!) to automatically tag articles with the new logic banner for the purpose of assessment. I put together a category list, publicized the issue, and then moved forward with no objection. Well the complainers came out of the woodwork! The bot was stopped and at this point most have been untagged. I find all of this quite terrible.

Since then, I have been working on WP:PHILO with all of these task forces. I got the sense that people were a lot less uptight in general over there. I have changed direction a bit and now am advocating that the philosophy project tag incorporate these fields and be placed appropriately, etc. However, there is no real enthusiasm for the auomatic bot tagging proposal. Although there is far less hostility to it!  

I intend to ask the bot to tag just the Aesthetics project and see how things go. I haven't put this proposal out to WP:PHILO yet, I wanted to give you a chance to comment on it. Any advice or support in these goals would be appreciated."

 When asked """"Are you an agnostic or an atheist?"""", Russell replied:
Agnostic, of course. Atheists are like Christians: That is, both dogmatically mantain that we can know whether or not there is a God. The Christian holds that God does exist; the atheist holds that God does not. But the agnostic knows that we simply do not possess sufficient grounds either to affirm or deny the existennce of a supreme being. So I believe that although the existence of God is not impossible, it is improbable. Quite improbable.

A more clarifying answer, as mentioned above, can be found in Am I An Atheist Or An Agnostic? (1947), where Russell states:


As a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one prove that there is not a God. On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think that I ought to say that I am an Atheist, because, when I say that I cannot prove that there is not a God, I ought to add equally that I cannot prove that there are not the Homeric gods.

 """"Myth of 'Flat Earth' belief""""? 

The titling of this article has been difficult, as the """"myth"""" it is about is not about the false idea that the Earth is flat (see Flat Earth), but of whether there was a general belief in that false idea in Europe during the Medieval Period. I invite comment on whether """"Myth of 'Flat Earth' belief"""" would be a better title.  ~  (talk) 

Russell calls it the “modern Flat Earth Error” or just the “Flat Error” in Inventing the Flat Earth (1991). In a 1997 conference he then refers to it as “the myth of the flat earth” (no capitals anywhere). None of these variants convey what the actual error is, and of course the reason Russell doesn’t try is that a literally accurate name would be quite long, something along the lines of “the modern misconception of a medieval European belief in a flat earth”. “Myth of a 'Flat Earth' belief” isn’t horrible, but it’s still not likely to mean anything to someone who doesn’t already know what it’s supposed to mean, in which case we haven’t achieved anything by changing. Russell’s book title works better than any of these other attempts. Something along the lines of “Flat Earth concoction” would give less chance for someone to mistake the article as a description of the belief that the earth is flat, something that has already happened twice in just the call for a capitalization change.   
 Comment: We don't care if Russell likes to overcapitalize in ways that MOS:CAPS doesn't sanction (and the source cited above suggests that there's a """"myth of Russell's capitalization"""" at work here. Heh.) WP has a convention of not capitalizing such labels, even for universally accepted theories.  """"Modern flat earth error"""" is a good start toward settling on a WP article title that makes sense. This article is about a modern belief about pre-modern belief in a flat earth. How do we address that most clearly? Two previously mentioned possibilities were """"Modern misconception of prevailing Middle Ages' belief in a flat Earth"""" (which has a possessive usage error), and """"Modern misconception of prevailing belief in a flat Earth in history"""".  I think I'd go with: '' (with precisely that capitalization; see above RM, which can and should proceed in the interim to comply with WP:MOSCAPS, since this """"what should this  be titled"""" discussion could drag out for who knows how long, if it ever gets resolved).  —  ☏ ¢ ≽ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ≼  09:"""

 Suggestions for Improvement 

Introduction
The information presented in the introduction is a little scattered. It jumps from the creation of the North West Company, to competition with the Hudson Bay company, and then all the way to its revival in 1990. There is very little explanation of the connections between these events (especially the final sentence about its revival). This makes the introduction more confusing than anything. I suggest that either the introduction be extended in order to create a thought-process that is easier to follow, or eliminate the final sentence entirely since it doesn't really relate to the rest of the paragraph. 

Before the Company
An explanation of """"the conquest of 1763"""" would be very useful. it should not be assumed that someone looking up the North West Company is familiar with other events in Canadian history. Even making it a link to another page would suffice. 
Additionally, a more detailed explanation of English and French expansion into western Canada would be beneficial. 

Citations
Even though there is a large amount of detailed information here, there are very little footnotes to back up the information. This is a problem that I noticed throughout the article. At times, there are entire sections that have no citations whatsoever. This damages the credibility of the information presented and the page as a whole.

 Ramdasia are Chamars - Links and sources provided

Panjab castes by Sir Denzil Ibbetson (http://www.archive.org/stream/panjabcastes00ibbe#page/n7/mode/2up)

On Page 269, the author writes: """"Similarly, if the Ramdasias do not follow the occupation of Chamars, it is no reason to separate them from that castes. So if a Ramdasia is Julaha, that is a weaver, and if he is 'Bazzaz' that is a draper, his caste remains unchanged. If a Chamar, a leather-worker becomes a Sikh and receives 'pahul' to-day, he at once joins the Ramdasias. The Ramdasias do receive the daughters in marriage of ordinary Chamars, but give them 'pahul' before associating with them"""".........""""The the Ramdasi is still a Chamar"""". 

On page 300, the author writes: """"The Sikh Chamar or Ramdasia. — It will be seen from Table VIII A that in the north and centre of the Eastern Plains a very considerable number of Chamiirs have embraced the Sikh religion. These men are called Ramdasia after Gui-u Ram Das, though what connection they have with him I have been unable to discover. Perhaps he was the first Guru to admit Chamars to the religion. Many, perhaps most of the Ramdasia Chamars have abandoned leather-work for the loom ; they do not eat carrion, and they occupy a much higher position than the Hindu Chamars, though they are not admitted to religious equality by the other Sikhs. The Ramdasia are often confused with the Raidiisi oi Rabdasi Chamars. The former are true Sikhs, and take the pdhul. The latter are Hindus, or if Sikhs, only Nanakpanthi Sikhs and do not take the pcikul ; and are followers of Bhagat Rav Das or Rab Das, himself a Chamar.

I think this is just a bit silly that you can't see your own biases. Why can't you see your own biases? Or had you considered the fact a good majority of Wikipedia editors share a Left of center POV by Jimmy Wales' own admission? The bias is hardly in a conservative direction, or even neutral. How can you say there isn't a decided hostility to conservative or traditional points of view on Wikipedia
Wikipedia's NPOV rule is meaningless, considering this fact. Explain to me why you think my observation of fact is absurd? Wikipedia isn't a reliable source because this fact, and if you hadn't been reading students in colleges in America, at least, are discouraged from citing it because of serious factual errors and political biases that pass for the truth. 
The problem here IS NOT with me.  
Guy, I wish you could see how the world views Wikipedia, and it's not good. Wikipedia's NPOV rule is symbolic, and from what I have seen no one here follows it. I have read all of the rules,and I have made every effort to follow them. Do everyone a favor and declare that Wikipedia is a Left-wing site. e.g.,  a blog. It comes down to an ideosyncratic application of the rules to fit your worldviews.
FM writes for the Democratic Underground, Jim68sch has confessed to having Marxist sentiments and you have confessed to being sympathetic to homosexuality. So, how can you say that there isn't a Left of center bias on Wikipedia?  I am mentioning the fact I Googled FM's handle, and found posts under his handle on the decidedly Liberal/Socialist Democratic Underground because it shows where his political biases lay.
How then can he be anymore objective than I?
FM said I weakened his viewpoint that Dominionism was a threat or a problem by adding the viewpoints of self-professed Christian Reconstructionists to the Dominionism article. How can you say that he's neutral anymore than I am neutral. My beef with that particular article is that it seems to stereotype all conservative American Christians as wanting to replace the U.S. Constitution with a neo-Puritan theocracy. 
Wikipedia lacks the same quality as Encyclopedia Britannica when it comes to maintaining a non-partisan perspective?
I consider myself knowledgeable about the Christian right, at least the Catholic faction therof, and I object to what I see as the blatant stereotyping of conservative Christians. The fact Chip Berlet or Katherine Yurica are considered """"experts"""" furthers my perception of bias. Mr. Berlet, I will concede, is more factual than say Ms. Yurica, but he paints with a very broad brush that ignores the diversity of the Christian right.
Their writings are riddled with strawman attacks, guilt by association, glaring generalizations, etc. The series of articles on """"Dominionism"""" are riddled with factual errors and POV. Is it NPOV to limit the content to a single POV where only those who share a single POV are granted """"expert"""" status?
I will leave Wikipedia alone for awhile, and perhaps limit myself to editing on the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox-oriented pages. When it comes to politics, Wikipedia is of limited informative value.

0,""":Let me first of all set the record straight about the history of the relationship between myself and User:Jza84. On his talk page Jza84 states 'I hardly know the editor bar an passing in a discussion from time to time'. As Mangojuice notes on that same page, 'Jza clearly knows Enaidmawr is a long-time established editor here; Jza interacted with Enaidmawr as early as November 2007, over 6 months before Jza became an admin.' That interaction was courteous and constructive and repeated on a number of occasions. I wouldn't claim that we were regular collaborators, but collaborate we did, and if somebody had aske me, before this incident, 'do you know this editor and do you have a good working relationship with him?' I would have replied in the affirmative, without hesitation. The only real """"edit conflict"""" I had with him prior to this was in February of this year, at British Day. This was resolved civilly and without rancour, although I have to admit that I found his attitude at the time patronising - """"A lesson would be it took all of five minutes to strengthen the article up with a few references."""" - and felt that the zealousy with which he reacted to my edits - an effort to bring balance to a biased account, in my opinion, for what it's worth - whilst ignoring a number of dubious and unsourced statements and peacock terms for the opposing view of the subject, was unbalanced. However, I refrained from comment (see Brit Day in his talk page archive). 'Everybody is entitled to their views', I said to myself, and moved on. I'll admit that I tended to avoid him after that as I had no wish to get embroiled in anything: I've got better things to do. I could have responded to this comment on Talk:Newport which I found to be deeply insulting to all Welsh people: saying that Daicaregos was 'an advocate of """"Welsh nationality"""" (which doesn't exist, verifiabily)(). That statement left me with the indelible impression that Jza84 denied the nationality of myself and all Welsh people. I thought that was a very hurtful comment and completely unnecessary and I am sure that most Welsh people would feel the same way. However, once again I did not respond even though I was part of that discussion and was sorely tempted to do so: 'Ignore it', I told myself. Shortly later I became aware of a series of edits by Jza84 removing Welsh nationality and replacing it with 'British' on a number of articles on my watchlist; amongst them was the article on Dafydd Wigley, Plaid Cymru's senior statesman. Rightly or wrongly, I was by then convinced that Jza84 had a personal agenda on this matter. I reverted some edits and ignored others not on my watchlist as I genuinely did not want to get involved in a dispute (and no, it had nothing to do with his admin status). However, when I saw his edit to Template:Welsh kingdoms, also on my watchlist, I will admit that I was incensed. I reacted with less tact than I should have done, I admit. I reverted his edit. Changing 'Welsh kingdoms' to the woefully incorrect and insulting 'Brittonic petty kingdoms of Wales' seemed to me to confirm my impression of him: it basically de-Cymricised the major kingdoms of medieval Wales, which have a central place in our history and identity, used a term which is both incorrect and open to misinterpretation by the general reader (not everyone is aware of the meaning of the rather obsolete and affected term 'petty kingdom'). He than undid my edit and came up with the wording 'Ancient kingdoms of Wales', which is again quite simply incorrect ('medieval' is not 'ancient'). Then I read his """"explanation"""" on the talk page. Quite frankly I thought he was taking the mickey. It also confirmed me in my opinion that he had an agenda of denying the Welsh people their identity (quote: 'What exactly are the Welsh kingdoms? Kingdoms inhabited by the Welsh?  Well, no, the Welsh are a modern nation who live in Wales. Are they subdivisions of Wales?  Well, also no, these kingdoms pre-date Wales by centuries (Wales was a concept of the future!'). 'What fools historians, Welsh and others, have been to refer to such icons of Welsh history as Llywelyn the Great as Welsh (and his court poets who praised him as 'King of the Welsh' etc.)', I said to myself. At that point I should have taken a deep breath and walked away to make a coffee, count to several thousand and then respond. But I did not, and the result is this. That sets the record straight. I've already apologised for any offense I may have caused and given my opinion of Jza84's decision. I write this to let my peers who have commented and acted on the matter get the 'history' behind this incident from my point of view. I do not intend to respond here to other things which have been said or implied here and at Jza84's page about"

There is a question of garnering donations from America and Europe with sob stories of anti-Christian violence, involved in the large number of articles being posted on anti-Christian violence in India, with seperate articles for each and every incident for whatever reason on anyone bearing a seemingly Christian name. This is good for India also because it brings in foreign direct investment.

 The Burke Group 

In response,  I never provided where he went to school.   I added  he is a J.D.    RAther than delete he is a J.D. (Juris Doctor)  then refer to him as Dr.  David Burke?  A J.D. is a Doctor of Jurisprudence same as a Ph.D.   Why do you allow personal information that's good for you but not for others who might be interested in knowing more?  He was important enough to post an article so why do you think any reader will be satisfied with a sum total of data saying  he owns a rental property in Agoura Hills with a meaningless political contribution?  The property posted is a rental  where he no longer lives and maybe never did.   How is that useful in an article about organized labour? You said it yourself the article should be about the company.  But in actual fact, he IS the company.    He's a flight instructor whom I know from our FBO (Flight Base Operation).  Lots of people know him.   He hasn't contributed to Republicans for years.  Look at the site you  provided!!  Last one was 2004.  Why continue to keep outdated useless information?  The article cited by Dr. John Logan, a very learned fellow, contains some useful info but also contains factually incorrect information. Even he can make mistakes.   I am a lawyer and Logan is a British economist, and may understand E.U. law but does not understand U.S. labor law.  Just because he writes about it does not mean he understands it.  There is NO newspaper article about CDN that says employees were awarded from the Court of Appeals.  He wrote incorrectly.    The citation provided which corrects his article  is  from the court dockets.  Which is a better citation?    I provided the citation from  the law firm that WON the civil case against CDN!!   I removed nothing  about the case itself.... only corrected the information in such a way that the non legal lay person could understand the fundamental differences between NLRB law and DOL law and civil actions filed with the District Courts.   What John Logan wrote that you cite is liking saying someone was cited by the F.A.A. but tried at the D.M.V.!!!  Are you British?  F.A.A. is Federal Aviation Admin. and D.M.V. is Dept. of Motor Vehicles.  They are not related anymore than NLRB is to District Court or civil cases..   Burke works in NLRB jurisdiction and the case you cite is a Civil Action in District Courts not related.    If you want CDN  discussed,  first part is fine but the civil action is not.  there should be another topic developed in wikipedia for CDN.    Logan's article  used as a citation  lacks any credible legal citation connecting Burke to the civil case.   Only a legal citation should be used.   There are none available.    DJB is a very well known person and lots of lawyers both company and union know him. No matter which side of the aisle...this information is flawed.    If you are going to discuss legal issues then get them right.  Am I being picky?  Yes.  Inside the law you can't just throw something at the ceiling and hope it sticks.   Deleting FACTS for FICTION is beneath the dignity of what Wikipedia has strived to promote.    Why do you say the article contains everything anyone needs to know to justify deleting contributions?   How is that possible when Wikipedia is an opened forum for knowledgeable people to build and add more?  You think the sum total for the reader should be that Burke owns a rental property in Agoura HIlls?  How is that related to THe Burke Group?  Please stop  the generalities and provide  3 facts I contributed and tell me EXACTLY how the citation or """"tone"""" can be improved and let me do that.  Also, please define what is meant by """"tone"""".   By the way...are you a Wikipedia staff editor or administrator?  Thank you.  arabianrider  """

 This Evolution Thread Is A Perfect Example Of Why No One Ever Takes Wikipedia Seriously 

There is no such process as """"evolution"""". It does not exist. """"Evolution"""" is FICTIONAL. There is no process in which species morph into other species. There is no process in which fish jump out of the ocean, decide they will start breathing air, grow arms and legs and eventually morph into a multitude of various land creatures. """"Evolution"""" can only be described at best as a science fiction spoof, and it is really even too preposterous for that

The simplest way I can get this through your moronic heads

Unicellular organisms DO NOT convert into multicellular organisms. End of story, end of your crock theory 

Forget the fact that there are no """"transitional"""" fossils on Earth, or that it is impossible for a DNA code to spontaneously add or subtract chromosomes (become a different species), or that this asinine process has NEVER happened once in the entire recorded history of biology. Forget the fact that every scientific and biological fact known to man prove that """"evolution"""" does not exist and never could. Or that every single legitimate scientist in the world realizes """"evolution"""" is a farce

""""There is no such thing as evolution."""" ~Albert Einstein

Forget all of that and just get that first fact through your head. Single cell organisms do not convert to multi-celled. You're insane species morphing crock of idiocy is DOA

The associated state would only have the right to be consulted.

And the U.S. would have to accept that every third-country national holding a residence title of a Schengen state could enter the U.S. without even being checked.

 No association between """"Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory"""" and """"Bell Labs""""? 

Earlier on this page,  had enquired:

Name origin
Wasn't the parent company (and hence weren't the labs) named after Alexander Graham Bell?  No mention of him can I find here. Carrionluggage 

Today User:BilCat deleted a recent section addition to the article titled """"Early namesake"""" in its entirety, which chronicled the """"Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory"""", also known as the Volta Laboratory (which A.G. Bell created after he won the Volta Prize). The deleted section was titled 'Early namesake' for the reason that there was an association by name as follows:
 1876 –A.G. Bell receives master phone patent, becomes part owner of the Bell Telephone Company, later renamed American Bell Telephone Company;
 1880 –A.G. Bell creates the Volta Laboratory, a.k.a. the Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory, for research into sound recording and transmission, including the photophone; also
 1880 –""""the management of American Bell created what would become AT&T; Long Lines."""" A.G. Bell still owns shares in ABTC, and hence thus is part owner of AT&T;  he remains """"Chief Electrician"""" of ABTC and its children for several years;
 1881 –Western Union withdrew from the telephone market and allowed Bell Telephone to acquire its telephone manufacturing arm Western Electric;
 1885  –The long lines project """"was formally incorporated into a separate company named American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T;)"""";
 1899  –""""the American Telephone and Telegraph Company bought the assets of American Bell""""  (that would appear to be a friendly takeover of the parent corporation by the child);
 1925 –Bell Labs is created, and assumes the research roles conducted by Western Electric Research Laboratories and part of AT&T;'s engineering department.

Whether any research projects were passed from the Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory to the Western Electric Research Laboratories or AT&T; Engineering, and then onto the newly created Bell Labs is moot, since the section was entitled Early namesake and never inferred that there was such a connection. That there was a connection by name and share ownership, as shown above, is obvious; therefore the deleted section has now been reinstated as pertinent to the Bell Labs article.  Comments?    """

Nor does it mean that races are not social constructs as is the prevailing view among anthropologists and social scientists, because the particular genetic differences that correspond to races only become salient when racial categories take on social importance. From this sociological perspective, Edwards and Lewontin are therefore both correct.""""

He also wrote a very perceptive review of Platform, one of the few French novels I've struggled through in the original, and which I thought was anarchically funny though I do finds 'Wally' rather bleak.

Once again, User:EconProfessor has insisted on wholesale removal of sourced content because it apparently conflicts with her opinion of Donna Hughes. EconProf summarizes the edit as follows:

Sorry, but just because it may reflect negatively on Donna Hughes does not in itself make mention of the incident POV. The sourced articles clearly state that negative attention was brought to Megan Andelloux and the CSPH through the efforts of Donna Hughes. A zoning battle over the CSPH immediately followed, and the zoning issues may or may not have had their own merits. The degree to which Donna Hughes emails and negative publicity played a role is a matter of argument, and I have be quite careful to preface the statement with """"Supporters of Andelloux claim...""""

The article states that """"Montenegrin and Serb identities are not exclusive"""", but this is not true. They are exlusive acording to the constitution of Montenegro, the constitutional charter of Serbia and Montenegro, and half a dozen separate censuses since the mid 20th century - all of which allow only one national identity to be declared. These are the raw and unbiased facts (not speculation). On the other hand, it is true that a number of Serbs and Montenegrins may believe that they have both identities - but there is no modern census nor constitutional basis that can support a statement such as """"Montenegrin and Serb identities are not exclusive"""". Many Montenegrins do not feel to be Serb, and never pronounce themselves as such. You can not force national groups to """"be Serb"""" if they do not feel so and never declare as such.

""""However the number of Montenegrins does seem to be in steep decline since the introduction of the category by the Communists on the 1948 census"""" seems to imply that the Communist regime declared the nationality of citizens in polls. This is not true, as citizens declared their nationaility in polls, individually. In fact, the Communists - for the first time allowed citizens to declare their nationality as Montenegrin - by introducing the category, which is more important. If it stands like the previous user wants it to stand, then we must add a sentence stipulating that the """"Serbian ruling dynasties in the pre World War II Yugoslavia banned Montenegrin citizens from declaring their nationality as 'Montenegrin'"""" This is as true as the Communist quirp, as the Montenegrin option was obviously not allowed before World War II.

The article states that MOC was not re-established in 1993, which is a fallacy. The MOC has been legally registered in Montenegro in line with the valid legal system of the state of Montenegro and in line with the laws in Montenegro - which is clearly apparent from the MOC page on Wikipedia. The MOC Church is called the Montenegrin Orthodox Church in its formal registration in Montenegro, so there is no space for speculation here. The Church was re-established after a separate existence until 1920. 
The article does not claim that MOC is a major branch of Eastern Orthodoxy outside Montenegro. 

The statement """"over 74% of Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church"""" is anyway a fallacy, as there is no accurate census that can prove this. One may say truthfully say that """"most Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church"""", but a large number of Montenegrins are atheists, agnostics, or otherwise, myself included. Being a Montenegrin does not mean that you are part of the 74% of Eastern Orthodox Christians. Sorry, this is the 21st century.

You can not just delete the fact that MOC followers claim that """"all of the existing churches in Montenegro were once part of an autonomous Montenegrin Orthodox Church that was abolished following the union with Serbia in 1918."""" This is the explanation why shrines are not being built en masse in Montenegro by the MOC, as it claims to inherit the churches currently in the hands of SOC. If we put only one viewpoint in """"its following is small to the point of non-existence and it has not been recognised by any other Orthodox Church"""" it is not balanced. Also, the statement """"its following is small to the point of non-existence"""" needs to be based on fact not fancy. Do you have an official census of followers, or is this based on the fact that you are a believer of the SOC?

The sentence """"The validity of the referendum was not confirmed by international observers as the allegedly free and democratic vote, in fact took place during wartime in the former Yugoslavia."""" is true. So I leave it. Of course, I agree to change """"international"""" into """"OSCE, EU and US"""" - as the referendum may have had international monitoring from Cuba, Iraq, North Korea, Byelorussia, and Russia.

Can you please try to see the glass being half full instead of half empty.  I'm certainly not trying to do anything that you or others would see as """"problematic"""".  Five weeks ago I was getting involved in wikipedia and I was feeling enthusiastic, so I posted something to some user groups (reaching 10,000+ members), encouraging them to contribute to wikipedia.  I thought, at the time, that long-time wikipedia people would be more welcoming of new people, and that wikipedians would be happy that I encouraged others to participate.  I was not trying to target and encourage employees of a commercial product to contribute.  The groups I posted to were user groups, not employee groups.  But yes, I guess that some employees belong to these groups as well.  And my comment about Hill using the talk page was simply to comment that my personal POV is that he found a good way for someone with COI to contribute. 

I feel that the negative and accusing tone of your last sentence is unwarranted. It is un-welcoming comments like that that drive away new wikipedia contributors.  I see my wikipedia contributions as a way of giving unselfishly to the world, trying to spread knowledge and improve understanding.  I think that even if I only have time to make a small number of contributions, I feel I am helping, and that this should be the spirit of wikipedia.  So seeing your criticism that I am not making enough edits to non-commercial products is just frustrating and disheartening to me.
I hate feeling that I have to defend my reputation here, and I don't agree with you that editing non-commercial pages should improve anyone's appearance of trustworthiness.  However, your claim that I am only editing the wikipedia entries of """"these commercial products"""" is also just incorrect.  I don't know if there is a way to view the wikipedia contributions of others, but if there is, you would see that I've been making edits to many non-commercial pages, including CRISP-DM, Data mining, the journal Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, Predictive analytics, Statistics, Customer retention, Predictive Model Markup Language, Anomaly detection, SEMMA, Machine learning, Jacques Cousteau, SIGKDD, Decision tree learning.  Sometimes I'm making simple formatting edits, and sometimes I'm spending hours trying to track down the right references to put on the CRISP-DM page.  Yes, my edits are mostly in the general area of data mining, because that is where I have the greatest interest and knowledge.  Similarly, when I guest lecture at local universities, I lecture to these types of classes, not due to any collusion, but because that's what I know.

Thanks for listening to my mini-rant.  I know I'm taking this more personally than you probably meant it.  But it bothers me when someone questions that I am not working hard enough or they question my ethics, and that's what your comments feel like.  All I'm asking is that long-established wikipedia people be more welcoming and encouraging, and give new people the benefit of the doubt that they are acting in good faith trying to make meaningful contributions (however small).  New people grow and adjust - but it takes a while to learn the conventions of the wikipedia community.  Please be patient and encouraging to new people.

I'm going to leave this discussion now.  If needed, I will return to it after the holiday season.  But I hope there is no need to.    """

Extra Terrestrial Biological Entity

EBE is an abbreviation for the term Extra Terrestrial Biological Entity.

In the 1940's several alien spacecraft were allegedly recovered by the U.S. and other countries, along with a few dead aliens and one live one. These beings were referred to as EBEs (a name suggested by Dr. Vannevar Bush).

The term was first made reference to in 1986 when Jenny Randles interviewed a military soldier named """"Robert"""" about some stolen Top Secret US Military papers. The term was first made public in 1987 with the release of the Majestic 12 documents by Timothy Good (a)(b):

""""Dr. Detlev Wulf Bronk's team has suggested the term """"Extra Terrestrial Biological Entities"""" (EBEs), be adopted as the standard term of reference for these creatures until such time as a more definitive designation can be agreed upon.""""  (b)

In a letter to researcher William Steinman, Dr. Robert I. Sarbacher who was with the Washington Institute of Technology, confirms that some of the scientists involved in the study of recovered flying discs from Roswell were Dr. Vannever Bush, John von Neumann, and Dr. Robert Oppenheimer. (c) Steinman also discovered that one of the scientists working on saucer technology from the early days was Dr. Eric Henry Wang who became Director of the Department of Special Studies, within the Structures Division, of the old Wright Air Development Center, near Dayton, Ohio. 

This term has been often used in the TV series X-files.

Fair use rationale for Image:Vivavariety.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:Vivavariety.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

I agree with Off2riorob.  This picture is very unclear by itself.  It could easily be captioned the other way and no-one would know the difference.

0,""":::: But in what sense can that comment possibly be “correct”? """"Provided that what is sourced is already in the article""""! I can't let that pass, as it is just so damaging - so I'm going to say a few things. You cannot just ‘summarise’ any old group of citations (sometime creating a new thing altogether in doing so - which is excempt from needing proof) – you are absolutely obliged to consider WP:weight, along with other of the many guidelines like WP:red flag in Verifiability, and Notability too. Weight alone will more often than not dictate the new text, as it has done now. 

These retentive methods of ‘Style reviewing’ are a plague across the full scope of Wikipedia, and this article highlights the foolishness (too long maintained) of methodically tick-boxing inherently illogical style-correctness, whilst routinely (ie as a kind of 'policy') ignoring content( which is ironically seen as the job of the editors, who actually get sidelined in the process). In teh past I've seen so many foolish paragraphs pass though ‘style’, even in Featured Articles (another content-shy process believe it or not). There really is nothing clever about being so clinical when it leads to plain misrepresentation, especially with a subject like this. Many non-British would will be mislead by the text on a basic ‘reader’ level here anyway, which just adds more irony to the process of course . As a rule, it is good to consider what you are doing in life in anyway, regardless of your job.

What happened in Nick Griffin is that simple event-verifying  citations from within the article (the few cases of Griffin being invited to speak at mainstream establishments) were converted into a kind of super-flexible ‘source’ material’, which (in that new state) were easily moulded into the stand-alone line """"Since he became the leader of the BNP several educational institutions have invited him to speak on political radicalism, multiculturalism, and BNP policy."""" I strongly suspect that no one got a shoe-in to actually add any weight, due to the rigid system involved - where new  content is demoted in value, and even at times discouraged. I’ve seen it happen too often, it’s just plain dumb. What’s worse, a general ethos of ‘protecting the result’ comes from the process, which ended here in me being accused of ‘vandalism’ for attempting change, which I really object to. It really is dumb.

Imagine someone collecting a handful of citations of various people expressing an opinion (shall we say of black people being inferior to whites?) and places them in a relevant section in an article (say a """"Controversy"""" section in a new and developing article called """"Racism"""") . According to Wikipedia’s Style Council, this line inserted at the end of the intro would theoretically be fine: """"Many people believe that black people are inferior to whites”. As there was nothing in the developing article about the many issues surrounding IQ test and the reading of them both past and present, no balance is made, and the Intro passes with flying colours. The new authorised version is then considered as ‘passing consensus’ – a broadly finished thing that is duly protected from change.

The Intro equation I’ve seen many times is: X (citations of comments existing somewhere i n the article) = Z (a new flexible ‘source’ material  when grouped) = Y (a new and uncited statement of fact, based on the new entity of the ‘source’). THE INNER WORKINGS OF ‘SUMMARY’ ARE SIMPLY NOT APPARENT TO THE TYPICAL WIKIPEDIA READER, who is always at the very bottom of the Wikipedia heap, just below the general editor.

Articles like Nick Griffin can be difficult and need creative work on the edit level - but that is the point. So much time on Wikipedia is wasted on stylising incomplete articles and weak unbalanced text. It is no way to bypass edit conflict - that ‘’’has’’’ to be done the hard way, such as in finding ways to express weight. Risking edit battles is far superior to squeezing down to make-shift style-approved articles that are subsequently protected from change. Here that process made the introduction bland, weak and misleading, and the added factor of the subject's inherent extremity ensured the article became seriously misleading – to the point that the article became Nick Griffin-friendly, and hence ultimate"

Notability of Poornima Dilip
 A tag has been placed on Poornima Dilip requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.    """

Image copyright problem with Image:Vic indy-jones 001.jpg
 
Thanks for uploading Image:Vic indy-jones 001.jpg. However, the image may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and copyright status. The Wikimedia Foundation is very careful about the images included in Wikipedia because of copyright law (see Wikipedia's Copyright policy).

The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Copyright information on images is signified using copyright templates. The three basic license types on Wikipedia are open content, public domain, and fair use. Find the appropriate template in Wikipedia:Image copyright tags and place it on the image page like this: {{TemplateName}}.

Please signify the copyright information on any other images you have uploaded or will upload. Remember that images without this important information can be deleted by an administrator. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you."

 == Issue on images still unresolved == 

I appreciate your inputs in Image talk:Monkey3.jpg and I agree once in a while I might sound rude (purely unintentional, since I put facts blantly). But SlimVirgin is abusing his admin power to overrule anyone.

Slim is not a """"he"""". Given that she named herself after a Javanese princess, perhaps you could take the hint and note that she's a woman. Also, I don't think you were simply blunt. I think you were rude to Slim. I recognise it's a fine line but given that I've mentioned it to you, perhaps you'll take more care to stay on the right side of it?

She has suggested in an email to me, that she is in talks with another editor. Now, I don't know who this other editor and i certainly don't like this secrecy. Instead of having a discussion on this, she wants to finish the matter begind closed doors. She could've atleast told me who this reputed editor was to let me have a word with him/her.

Perhaps she is seeking guidance on how she should approach you and wants that to be untainted by your input. I think that would be reasonable. I have a high regard for Slim and I don't think she would have a nefarious purpose in speaking to a third party.

Inso far as the images are concerned, I had stated to her a couple of images on one issue (animal rights) is ok, but she insists she needs to showcase the entire album provided by PETA and its assocites.

So you have a dispute. You need to recognise that you are not necessarily right! You disagree about how many images are necessary. I feel that you have to allow that your disagreement might be fuelled by your political differences as much as how you interpret the image policy.

This should could easily achieve by providing an external link to the images provided by a controversial organization.

The BUAV is not a """"controversial organisation"""". It is a highly respected body, whose voice is listened to in all circles of British society. A viewpoint doesn't become """"controversial"""" just because you don't share it.

Wikipedia is supposed to be neutral and not have extreme viewpoints - 

But you expect it to reflect your viewpoint.

thus I requested her to limit her fair use policy in this regard to 2-3 images which can be used across similar articles. this she refuses.

I don't see how it is any fairer to use one, two or ten images in this instance. While I agree that Slim could have taken more care to provide a rationale for using the images, I simply don't feel that your argument about how many she should have used has much weight. One factor in deciding fair use is how much of a thing you use, that's true, but it's only one factor, and obviously, each picture is a separate case to be considered as well as part of a whole.

As far as the other images, some are on personalities she claims have """"agreed"""" to use their photos here. Unless she gets a written consent and a permission how can I believe.

First of all, you can believe Slim because you assume good faith. Perhaps you're not aware of that policy. Yes, you can ask Slim to provide evidence of that, but your assumption should be that she has in fact acquired that agreement. Harassing another editor to provide evidence to your satisfaction and insisting you won't believe them until they have do not show an assumption of good faith.

Once I pointed out that {permission} photos would be deleted anyway, she backed off and argued that it be kept on the grounds of fair use asking me to trust her.

Yes, okay. Trust her AND ask for proof.

Both of us are editing in good faith, but one of us has power and a circle of friends to back her while the other (me) relies on the hope that ppl. like you will help me out in this.

I'd urge you to rely on the issues rather than the personalities. Yes, Slim does have powerful friends, who will back her regardless, but you should still do your best to make it about the issue in question and not about her.

If she gets away with this and sets a precedence then I'm afraid there are hordes of copyviolaters straining at the leashes to bomb Wikipedia with copyrighted information.

''I think that's a bit dramatic but I agree that she has to obey the rules, which exist for good reason, and shouldn't be given a pass just because she is friends with the arbcom. However, she is not a """"copyviolater"""" trying to destroy Wikipedia. Partly, I think she simply didn't understand your problem, and that was in part a failure of your communication, and partly she has become too used to having her views echoed by her friends and doesn't handle disagreement well. So perhaps you could recognise that and be more helpful than combative? I know"

0,"""To Quote the Architect:

""""The matrix is older than you know. I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next, in which case this is the sixth version.""""

""""The first matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect, it was a work of art, flawless, sublime. A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is as apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being, thus I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature. However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. If I am the father of the matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.""""

Possibly v1 & v2 also had Ones? The Architect speaks of the anomaly being ineradicable despite his best efforts, in which case it would be present in the eutopia and dystopia versions too. This would explain why the Architect speaks of each version being identified by its anomaly, yet also says 'The first Matrix I designed', regarding the eutopia version, i.e. v1.

0,"TRPV1 agonist? 

It makes no sense. TRPV1 activation causes pain or heat sensation. Capsaicine is known to activate the receptor, and that's what makes chili pungent. If one of the reasons for AM404 being an analgetic was TRPV1 activation, it would have to be the opposite to that of capsaicine. The only wat in which TRPV1 agonism would decrease pain is that a prolonged exposure to high doses of the agonist decreases the sensitivity, which is the case in any type of receptor activation, but this would mean that AM404 is no more an analgetic than capsaicine or any other source of pain... and the relief would come after a period of pain actually getting worse.

Can anyone explain all this?"

FormerIP says,  """"I'd be fine with that, but this should not be done so as to ram home the idea that the earlier research is superceded."""" That's what I did in the version that I posted. But we have to consider the fact that these research reviews each looked at a different corpus, which isn't clear in the current version. Here is what Cochrane 2006 says:
 """"Inclusion criteria: Adults with a primary diagnosis of anxiety disorder (or corresponding to another diagnostic criteria including Diagnostic and Statistical ofMental disorders (DSM), International Classification of Disease -9(ICD-9) or ICD-10 clinical descriptions or research diagnostic criteria for neurotic disorders) with or without another comorbid psychiatric conditions, irrespective of gender, age, race or nationality.""""
The authors' criterion for inclusion was that the individuals in the study have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. They were psychiatric patients. That's why they excluded for consideration 46 of the 50 studies on anxiety that they found. They only wanted those studies on adults with a specific diagnosis: """"Using the diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorder (DSM or ICD classification) and limited to include only Randomised Controlled Trials, 46 studies were excluded from the early phase."""" Of the four studies that remained, one was on TM. Cochrane looked at a single study on TM.

Eppley looked at every study on TM that related to anxiety. Most of these were nonclinical studies, that is, they included subjects that hadn't been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. These studies, both meditation and relaxation, most commonly used the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, a standardized assessment of anxiety levels that's been validated in hundreds of studies, to assess the level of anxiety in the subjects. His meta-analysis included 35 studies on TM. In sum, the best way to represent these sources is to make it clear that they were looking at different populations of subjects, and hence, different groups of studies.   """

Dear Colleagues, 
I thank the various administrators and editors for their patience, and for their comments here, on the various talk pages and by email. Many comments have been made about procedural failures. Each of my steps in the dispute resolution process is prefaced with a request for advice and direction about how to do this properly, as I note here, because I did not know how to request, or manage, an ANI conduct review or MEDCOM mediation properly. A decision to block me was made, which I will not contest, based on comprehensive notes from two editors and accusations that I provide no evidence. I did not know how or when to do so, but I am learning quickly. In regard to arguments made by the editors  and , above, and upon which a decision was made to block me, I respond as follows:
 I reviewed a long history of contentious discussion and edits in Historicity of Jesus.
 I then posted a bold sourced here, which I encourage you to examine. You may see that they are in some cases minor clarifications, in others short simple neutrally toned presentations of divergent academic perspectives. In each instance the sources provided, apply only to the conceptual background of the claims made, and do not pertain to the specific line by line claims of this article, because, the citations largely concern the framework of the discussion not its extensive particulars.
 I started a talk page discussion
 Smeat75 reverted my edit without discussion here
 Smeat75 responded to my talk page discussion, but did not address the reasoning for the revision, here
 I continued discussion on the talk page and reverted back my edits here
 Ian.thomson reverted my edit with note of """"You must develop consensus"""" here
 I reverted with note """"""""Local consensus"""" is opposed by Wikipedia:Editing policy. Wait for external review."""" here
 I requested external review at WP:RFC and continued discussion on the Talk page here
 Ian.thomson reverted the edit I requested review on, again, here
 External review collapsed as editors ignored process and comments from external parties
 I had been following what I knew of appropriate policy and felt I was being repeatedly reverted without discussion or attempts to communicate, so...
 I then requested Dispute Resolution here, please read """"dispute overview""""
 Dispute resolution was opened, great comments received from many editors, and closed unresolved, as explained here
 On advice of DRN I applied to ANI for advice on resolution of conduct conflicts here, and to MEDCOM for content mediation here
 MEDCOM opened the request, 5 editors to date have agreed to mediation

Notability of Mighty Putty
 A tag has been placed on Mighty Putty requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

The classification list at the top insinuates that all mice belong to the genus Mus, but there are many genera of mice. Chaetodipus, Zapus, Napaeozapus, Onychomys, Baiomys, Ochrotomys, Peromyscus, Reithrodontomys, Oryzomys, Liomys, Micrdipodops and Perognathus all live in the United States alone (Whitaker 1991).  I couldn't even guess how many genera there must be in total. Mus only accounts for a miniscule portion of the richness and diversity of the animals we call mice. It should be noted as well that mice are a polyphyletic grouping since some mice are more related to some rats, for instance than they are to other mice.

Wow, I'm not even sure how to say that word. Have we recently crossed paths editing somewhere?   WikHead  

To be quite honest, I don't really know a lot about trees. I am however searching for a good central tree-related talk-page for you... somewhere where you might have a better chance of attracting other users with the knowledge you seek. If I can find a good link, I will most certainly post it here to your talk page. )   WikHead  

You're most certainly welcome! I'm guessing that the talk-page at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Forestry might be a really good place to find other users who can be of most help to you. I wish you the very best of luck with your updates. Have yourself a great day Curritocurrito, and happy editing! )   WikHead  

Hi Curritocurrito, thanks for your post at WikiProject Forestry. If you could elaborate a little more either there or at Talk:Dipterocarpaceae about what specific additions you might suggest for that article, that would be helpful. Thanks,   
Thanks for your reply. I suggest that you add your questions  """"why are they important? what habitat are they living? what animals eat their seeds? are they important economically? what minerals or grounds they need?""""  to the Talk:Dipterocarpaceae page. That will help others think about how they might contribute to that article.   
I don't get much time to edit Wikipedia pages, but am slowly trying to creat stubs for all the Dipterocarps and correct errors in existing stubs/article. If anyone is interested in editing these pages and needs access to primary sources - I have a reasonable collection of papers (mainly for SE Asia) and can send pdfs.
RE: the questions raised above
are they important economically? - they use to be the main timber export from SE Asia. I don't have figures for what % of the timber trade they account for now
what minerals or grounds they need?- variable - there is a high degree of habitat speacilsation. Some species only occur in Peatswamps, other in poor sand soils i.e. heath forests, others on rich clay soils.
what animals eat their seeds? - when they fruit, which varies from yearly in some of the Sri Lankan species to onces every x (2-16) years in some of the Borneo species - they are an important food source.

 Bridge to Teribithia 

Now that this anon has deigned to explain the removal of text, I've checked, and he or she is right; there is no mention of Young at IMDb, the film's page, or her own homepage. That User:Shelbyyoung has added this to the page on Shelby Young suggests strongly that she's not Shelby Young; moreover, if she were, she shouldn't be editing the article on herself. Mel Etitis (Talk)  
I haven't taken a stance on the role dispute (Shelby says that she performed the role and is uncredited, and IMDB doesn't list uncredited actors I believe). My comment was geared more toward User:Shelbyyoung's user page with the picture of her holding a notepad with her user name to prove her identity. This IP address shouldn't be removing that. Leebo T/C  
IMDb lists uncredited actors if they are given the information and some sort of verification; so if the real Young did appear in the film, it would be easy for her to get that credit added to her IMDb listing (heck, even my kid is in the IMDb, and her scene only appears as an """"alternate ending""""). That's got little to do with the impersonation question.Orange Mike  
1. Leebo is correct, IMDB doesn't list uncredited actors (only on special occasions, in fact. See the case of Owen Wilson in """"Night at the Museum"""". No onscreen credit, therefore no IMDB credit. It was only after users complained that Wilson had received credit in commercials, his credit was added. 
2. Regarding the film page, the page only lists the main actors involved in the film. It's not going to list a voice-over actress.

3. Shelbyyoung.com has not been updated since 2004-2005, so no credit after that would appear on the site, and is therefore, an invalid source.

4. Many people have edited articles on themselves here. To suggest that Shelbyyoung is not Shelby Young solely on the basis of the fact that she is editing her own article is faulty logic. I don't know how many people remember the case of the user juliannarosemauriello, who claimed to be the real thing, then went on to edit articles clearly not geared toward a (then) 14-year-old. To my mind, the fact that Shelbyyoung has only edited with regard to herself, and the photo, which 69.132.199.100 claims is photoshopped (and what a lovely trick that would be), proves Shelbyyoung's identity. 69.132.199.100 claims that the photo is a """"popular"""" one that has been photoshopped. If so, where is it? I see no evidence of a photo looking remotely like that doing any sort of image search. Ispy1981

Might we want either a temporary hatnote or a """"see also"""" for the present humanitarian crisis? I came here expecting to find a link to that article, wherever it may be, and couldn't find any. -  | Talk 

.  (moult with my mallards) 

A lot of this coverage is over at Cyclone Nargis.  Sadly, there just isn't a lot of information out there since access to the country is so tightly controlled, and even the assessment teams on the ground probably don't have the information we'd expect to see.  

 Name 

in the article, some parts say Burma, and some say Myanmar.

I think we should calll it Myanmar, since it may not be recognized by many countries, but that is the official (inter)national name.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Please read the tag at the top of the page.  The name is under dispute.  

 Moved the Page Move Protection tag to talk page 

There isn't really a need for the tag to be on the article itself. As was successfully argued regarding the """"dispute tag"""" previously, the tag itself doesn't help the article, and it being on the talk page achieves the same end.  

Having a warning on the front page shows that the article is in a state of flux.  Anyone who isn't particularly wiki-savvy wouldn't realize that there is an ongoing dispute and that the current version may well change in the near future.  The """"non-endorsement"""" of the current name of the article is a reasonable point to make.  I don't particularly care for either name, but making it look stable when it's unclear is kind of misleading to the reader.  

You're not making a lot of sense. The first sentence of the article notes the naming of the country. I believe you were involved with the discussion regarding the """"Dispute"""" tag, and it came to the point where the only sensible solution was to have it on the talk page. The same applies with this tag. It has nothing to do with honesty and I'd be insulted if I didn't assume good faith. Please reconsider your reversion, the last thing I want is an edit war of any sort.  

Look at the discussion on this page regarding the name dispute tag.  I wouldn't say that there was a consensus that removing the tag was the only """"sensible solution"""".
The statement is true and not misleading.  Neither staying nor moving are WP:SNOWBALL.
Protection tags are usually on the front page of the article.  See WP:PROTECT#Other_notes for talk page templates.
The tag deflects mastodons: Having the tag on the article itself sends a clear message to people who might just assume that the name is wrong and move it.
The tag shows that the current name of the article is not a consensus statement: Not having the tag implies to a casual reader that the current name is appropriate (not the current consensus because there is no consensus).
It seems kind of redundant to you or me since we've been staring at it for the last couple of weeks, but to someone who is not already involved it shows that the article is not stable.  I mean, I really don't care that much, but why is it so critical to take it off?    

Because disputes regarding page moves aren't what the user should be reading.  """

 The Title """"Mormonism and Christianity"""" 

I find that the title of this article immediately implies that Mormons are not Christians.  Would you say """"Catholics and Christians"""" or """"Presbyterians and Christians""""?  I feel a much better title would be something like """"The Controversy about 'Are Mormons Christians?'"""" or just """"Are Mormons Christians?"""".  I believe this is what you are really trying to discuss.

As for my personal opinion on this topic:  I have studied many religions.  The differences between Hindus, Buddhists, Jews, Muslims and Christians are obvious.  At this level, Mormons are certainly within the sphere of Christianity and Christian thought.  I doubt that members of any of these other religions would consider Mormons anything other than Christians.  Only from within """"Traditional Christianity"""" is there a controversy.  Just because Sunni Muslims believe the Shia are not truly Muslims, does that place them outside the Moslem world?

Bearing in mind that on Wikipedia, calling something an attack in a non-warzone in these times, basically means terrorism, and more often than not, will involve murder. To illustrate that - London attack is already a redirect to List of terrorist incidents in London which obviously has a link to this article, whereas London murder goes nowhere, and gives all sorts of random articles in the search results, none of which appear to be of any use to someone looking for this article. Similarly, Woolwich attack already redirects here, whereas Woolwich murder goes nowhere (although I'd have no objection to it coming here)."

This page is constatntly written to with opinions and non factual rubbish, which simply need changing and then leaving alone.

The article needs protecting and only updateable by official christian death facts.  People that want information about any past members will have to have pages dedicated to them.  But the article should be adhered to as much as facts allow.  3rd party discussion regarding Valor or Rozz should be eliminated in favour of the Christian Death Biography.

CHRISTIAN DEATH

BIOGRAPHY
&
Discography  

In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth. Then Christian Death turned it upside down.

History
Officially there have been over 30 musicians involved with the band. Therefore a historical litany of them all would be impractical.

Formed in Los Angeles and fronted by 16 year old vocalist/lyricist Rozz Williams, the band released the first album “Only Theatre Of Pain in 1982. A dark, sinister style of punk rock. The album gained local success. A year later the band completely broke up

Singer Rozz then joined the band “Pompeii 99' founded by singer, guitarist, song writer Valor.
Rozz took over vocals leaving Valor to focus on guitar. Before Rozz joined Pompeii 99, the band had already released their fist album “Look At Yourself” to much acclaim, which had an apocalyptic theme with a punk rock flavor. The Pompeii 99 had been planning their first tour when it was proposed by their French record company, to merge Pompeii 99 into a new version of Christian Death which after some debate was agreed upon. Thus, began the new Christian Death and the first Pompeii 99 tour became the first Christian Death tour.

Part way through the tour the band stopped in Wales to record songs, some of which were originally intended for the next Pompeii 99 album. The fusion of which led to the unique sound of the classic “Catastrophe   Ballet”.
Like the first Pompeii 99 album, Catastrophe Ballet had an apocalyptic theme, however the music morphed into something not quite Pompeii 99 and nothing like the first Christian Death album. After the tour the band returned to LA to later record the 3rd Christian Death album”Ashes”which was a post apocalyptic vision of a cold and bleak future. 

After confirming the 2nd tour in 85 singer Rozz quit the band. Valor returned to vocals, the band embarked on the 2nd tour. In Italy the band recorded the mini album “The Wind Kissed Pictures”, a surrealist view of a mystical past. Almost immediately work began on the 4th full length album “Atrocities” inspired by the atrocities of World War II and the connection to future shock waves. While continuously touring in 87 the band released the 5th and now classic album “The Scriptures”, the theme of which explored world religion and how the legacy of these beliefs impact our world today.

1988 Brought us the release of “Sex & Drugs & Jesus Christ”. This was turning point for the band. The cover depicted an image of Jesus shooting up heroin. This was a full frontal attack by Valor against the Church with a scathing heretical mockery of organized Christianity. The band then found themselves confronted by protesters, riots and bomb threats, These events and the bands imagery and fashion went on to influence the likes of Nine Inch Nails, Korn, Marilyn Manson, Type O Negative, every Goth band on the planet and many others.

1989 saw the release of the double album epic “All the Love, All the Hate” interpreting the juxtaposition between life and death, day and night, man and woman, black and white.

In 1991 came the release of “Insanus, Ultio, proditio, Misericordiaque”, with its theme of an ancient dream state.

Late in 91, after being in several other bands and seven years after quitting Christian Death, Rozz was persuaded by unscrupulous profiteers to perform at a concert in Los Angels under the name Christian Death. On the same day Christian Death was in Europe performing in Paris, France. Assuming this was a one time effort to earn extra cash, as explained to Valor"

0,"Moving on from that, I too can see an issue with the age of Aldrasto's posts. As I stated previously, my speciality is Egypt, not Rome, but the same issue arises with Egyptian sources of the same era.  Basically, scholars from this period have great difficulty in perceiving, accommodating, or finding language with which to describe beliefs which are not found in Christianity.  Rather, scholars of the period -consciously or not - tend to describe by analogy with Christianity.  An absolute classic example is the translation of maa kherau as 'victorious''triumphant' or 'vindicated'. The words mean 'a true voice' and literally means that what one says will come about - but the underlying concept bears no relation whatsoever to the Christian concept of being saved from sin, having overcome Satan through faith in Christ. The Kemitic Egyptians had nothing that equates to the Christian belief in the need for salvation. The reason for the choice of words appears to be connected to Matthew 17, where Jesus drives out a demon that his disciples had been unable to exorcise, and tells them that with even a little faith they could command mountains to move about. A man who had passed the test of the judgement hall obtained power in Amentet, such that what he commanded to happen would happen, therefore according to the Christian model, this must be because he had in some way achieved the status of a Christian saint."

 Your opinion please... 

I believe we discussed the phenomenon of wikipedians leveling accusation of """"original research"""" that stretch their definition of """"original research"""" to unreasonable extremes.

I've received another accusation of """"original research""""  this time from an administrator  who left an admonishment that could be interpreted as a threat of blocking, or some other sanction.

Could you take a look at this colloquoy?
Do you concur that conflating Yakup with Yakub was original research?

FWIW I believe this is the first exchange I have ever had with this administrator.

As before, I am happy to look for your reply here, on your talk page, if that is convenient for you.

Thanks!  —

 My letter to NeinN 

I am not NeilN's psychiatrist, and, as I haven’t examined NeilN, I won’t diagnose him. But because NeilN has turned himself into a public laboratory of psychopathology, I want to talk about how I'd give direction to a universal human development of culture, ethics, and morality. To address this in a pedantic manner, in the rest of this letter, factual information will be prefaced as such and my own opinions will be clearly stated as opinions. For instance, it is a fact that people used to think I was exaggerating whenever I said that like other volage-brained sensualists, he has a finely honed ability to welsh on all types of agreements. After seeing NeilN precipitate riots these same people now realize that I wasn't exaggerating at all. In fact, they even realize that when a friend wants to drive inebriated, you try to stop him. Well, NeilN is drunk with power, which is why we must drive off and disperse the obdurate bohemians who manufacture outrage at his castigators by attributing to them all sorts of uppity fairy tales.

If the only way to stop the Huns at the gate is for me to fall prey to NeilN's rhetoric and obfuscation, then so be it. It would sincerely be worth it because he had promised us liberty, equality, and fraternity. Instead, NeilN gave us sensationalism, propagandism, and officialism. I suppose we should have seen that coming, especially since NeilN claims to be supportive of my plan to confront and reject all manifestations of feudalism. Don't trust him, though; he's a wolf in sheep's clothing. Before you know it, he'll treat traditional values as if they were rapacious crimes. Not only that, but some benighted bloodsuckers are actually considering helping NeilN cause one-sided inclinations to be entered into historical fact. How quickly such people forget that they were lied to, made fun of, and ridiculed by NeilN on numerous occasions.

It's scary how effectively NeilN has been making a mockery of the term """"disproportionableness"""". I deeply regret the loss of life and injuries sustained by this tragedy. I am currently working to understand the surrounding circumstances so as to improve our ability to plant markers that define the limits of what is untoward and what is not. We have a dilemma of leviathan proportions on our hands: Should we strip the unjust power from those who seek power over others and over nature, or is it sufficient to put him in his place? In answer to that question I submit—and millions of people in this country and abroad unmistakably agree with me—that Bourbonism has served as the justification for the butchering, torture, and enslavement of more people than any other """"ism"""". That's why it's NeilN's favorite; it makes it easy for him to mute the voice of anyone who dares to speak out against him. You might think this is all pretty funny now, but I doubt I'll hear you laughing if, faster than you can say """"floccinaucinihilipilification"""", NeilN is successfully able to use paid informants and provocateurs to make higher education accessible only to those in the higher echelons of society. I've heard numerous complaints about his behavior. Many people I've talked to have complained that NeilN comports himself like a filthy pig, heedless of all needs but his own. Among these needs the paramount one seems to be the need to burn books. This backs up my point that he likes saying that better governance can be achieved by granting profitable concessions, permits, waivers, zoning variances, monopolies, and other such political machinations to his band. Okay, that's a parody—but not a very gross one. In point of fact, NeilN is extremely mawkish. In fact, my handy-dandy Mawkish-O-Meter confirms that prudence is no vice. Cowardice—especially NeilN's deplorable form of it—is. Now that you've read the bulk of this letter, it should not come as a complete surprise that some of the things NeilN says and some of the things he stands for are so feckless, it hurts to think about them. However, this fact bears repeating again and again, until the words crack through the hardened exteriors of those who would make a big deal out of nothing. I am referring, of course, to the likes of NeilN.

Hi,

Are you there Sue Anne? This needs your urgent attention.

Apropos my earlier message to you, I removed the pathetic PA from Royboycrashfan 's talk page and warned Crossmr against the PA along with a fair note. Please do read that note.

But he removed my first warning and also reverted back the pathetic PA comment on roy's user page ALONG WITH pathetic PA's AGAIN, in both edit summaries.

I gave him a final warning as he repeatedly violated NPA and would not cease and desist.

Yet he continued with his same unacceptable behaviour.

The edit histories of the talk pages of User_talk:Royboycrashfan and User_talk:Crossmr will make this very clear. He keeps deleting and reverting along with PA's in the edit summary inspite of being EXPLICITLY warned.

This is totally unacceptable. Please do take immediate action.

You know me, atleast a little. There is no way anyone can get away with calling me a vandal. You know I am not here to vandalize, but I have contributed meaningfully to a few articles whatever little time I have been on here.

Of course, there were a few misinformed civil issues along the way (which served to inform me about the policy on civility, NPA etc.), but after the block and blowing off a little steam, my behaviour has been perfectly good as can be expected of any genuine user.

even Vesther for that matter with whom I had a little argument would not call me a vandal.

Also there is another admin Nearly Headless Nick who has appreciated my edits to a certain page. 
Also have made a few edits to other articles the few times i was on.

But surely just because anyone is a very occasional user, that CANNOT be used as an excuse for letting anyone get away with PAs.

Also, NPA specifically states that earlier misinformed mistakes and behaviour CANNOT be used as an EXCUSE for a PA. 
If people kept harping on about old issues, it would become acceptable to attack anyone as everyone makes mistakes in the past.

Crossmr  just CANNOT be allowed to get away with his unacceptable MALICIOUS behaviour.

Please BLOCK him symbolically for whatever time you feel is right, to mainly PREVENT him and later forbid him from:

1. Reverting the pathetic PA on Roy's page along with the pathetic PA edit summaries.

2. Removing my very first warning message with a very civil note. I dont care about the second warning, but the first warning serves as a placeholder for record's sake.

Even after EXPLICIT and SPECIFIC warnings not to continue, he continued with his unacceptable behaviour and BLATANTLY violated NPA that too in edit summaries.
Even after being explicitly advised to assume good faith (AGF), he has failed to do so.

Cmon, for whatever you think of me (ur earlier silence), you KNOW I am not a vandal.

Please take appropriate steps as a fair and upright ADMIN.

I am logging off now, other stuff to do. Will log on tomorrow.

I do hope and expect you to symbolically block Crossmr, which will prevent him from continuing to behave unacceptably as he has blatantly violated NPA even after being repeatedly warned about it.

Thank you.

Best regards."

You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement """"I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later.""""

The reporter did no such thing. He never """"characterized it as evidence the theory was gaining traction"""" He made no opinion whatsoever, as to whether or not this was happening. He simply reported that ClimateProgressBlog said it was gaining traction, and quoted what Perino said. The fact that you feel that the reporter believed the quote from Perino was evidence that the theory was gaining traction is irrevelant. Our duty is to report the facts, and let the reader decide; not to draw a conclusion, based on what we've read, and then report that."""

I generally agree with Dr. Blofeld here.  My own view, which I think I may have never expressed out loud before, is that it is no longer wise or useful to restrict DYK links on the front page to new articles.  At one time, this may have been a good way to incentivize people to write new articles on interesting topics, now it may be leading to unnecessary recentism as well as limiting the scope of what ought to be one of our most amazing and charming front page features.  People, including me, love """"did you know"""" tidbits that are interesting and surprising - so why should we restrict ourselves to selecting just from new articles?  (And since I haven't commented yet, although my views are well known, I think using the Daily Mail as a source for fluff is a really bad idea, always.  There are rare cases where the Daily Mail and similar tabloids are acceptable for use in an encyclopedic context, but every use should be placed under the strictest possible scrutiny.)  """

0,"The arrest of Gerry Adams isn't front page news according to Wikipedia 

If you want to know why, read the Wikipedia:In the news/Candidates page. There you will find all sorts of uninformed, illogical, and downright dishonest claims about the UK legal system and the way the British press works. You will also see the quite idiotic claim that, by ignoring this news, Wikipedia is somehow defending Adam's from defamation - something apparently the rest of the world's media (and indeed Wikipedia's own article on Adams), isn't apparently all that concerned about. If like me, you think this is contemptible, and want to challenge it - then you will just have complain to your congressman I guess, because it has become clear to me today at Wikipedia talk:In the news that the people at Wikipedia who make those sort of arguments, will absolutely, positively, not answer any questions at all about it - and others will apparently defend their rights to do so, by closing down such discussions. Apparently it's 'disruptive' to question the logic that goes into faulty Wikipedia decision making like this. As always, if you want to know what's going on the world, consult the other 'old media' outlets who, for all their faults, still make it their job to report on the news in a serious and credible manner.

The accusation made by ChrisCh is baseless simply because more than myself have pointed out their objections to his extreme censorship of the Padua College wikipedia listing. I would further like to add my anger that a Wikipedia newcomer, Freedomfighter1112, has been indefinitely blocked for expressing his point-of-view. The actions taken by  and subsequently  I feel are actually in violation of Wikipedia's policy of not attacking the newcomers. It should be assumed that, in good faith, that Freedomfighter1112 would hope to assist the Wikipedia community in a positive way; however, with the actions taken by the two users mentioned previously, he/she has been prohibited from being able to accomplish this desire. We must remember that everyone makes mistakes, and mistakes are meant to be forgiven - especially in the case of a person's first edit. I would like to say only once - I DO NOT KNOW, OR HAVE ANY CONNECTION WITH FREEDOMFIGHTER1112 AND THAT THE ACCUSATION OF SOCKPUPPETRY IS BASELESS AND THE INDEFINITE BLOCK PLACED AGAINST FREEDOMFIGHTER1112 SHOULD BE OVERTURNED IMMEDIATELY.

Sincerely Yours,

 Whole Lotta Darwin? 

Just a query. Is the appearance of Charles Darwin in every section of today's Main Page except """"In The News"""" intentional?   
Almost certainly. As you'll have noticed, it's his 200th birthday. Algebraist 
Here is the discussion on the timing of today's featured article. Algebraist 
Shiny. Thanks )   
It's also Abraham Lincoln's 200th birthday and he gets shafted.    
He's mentioned once in OTD and twice in DYK. If you had a relevant TFA choice, you should've posted it to Wikipedia:Today's featured article/requests at the appropriate time (weeks ago). Algebraist 
I stand corrected, but it is still 5:3 in favor of Darwin.  
Is your suggestion to put licoln's name twice randomly on main page to make it even? The way i see it both were given importance and there is no reason for them to appear exactly the same number of times. there were featured items available for Darwin, hence they were used. if u have suggestion to improve current items then please provide them rather than complaining about ratio.   
Insert picture of Wikipe-tan huggling Darwin and lonely Lincoln off in the corner.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 75.73.70.113   
He needs the love; over at the ever understated and equitable Conservapedia, he appears on the main page in a split-image alongside Adolf Hitler.  
Yeah, I love the way Conservapedia manages to give the impression that racism from the likes of Hitler and (allegedly) Darwin is a bad thing... but as I recall some of the things they said about Obama during last year's campaign... """"understated and equitable,"""" indeed. 168.9.120.8  
Hey - this'll start a bunfight. It could be argued that in the grand scheme of things, Darwin is way more important - his discoveries have a worldwide importance and effect, while ol Abe really only affected the US. 86.155.202.152

Not at all, you are making a straw man argument here. I never claimed O'Donohue had that position, rather that practitioners and researchers in the field ignored the DSM position, which is exactly what the quote says and also something O'Donohue agrees with. 

Again, I was combating the notion that it was a """"absurd part"""" to claim that pedophilia is a sexual orientation. Since many researchers hold this position, it would be unfair to call it absurd. The disorder part is divided in the field, some argue that it is not a disorder at all, some do.

Please read WP:DELETE. A no consensus result at AFD means only that there is no consensus to delete an article and its edit history altogether; anything else, including merging, is a normal editing decision. When, as here, that non-consensus is divided between those who would delete, and those who would merge and redirect, that's consensus that we don't need a separate article.  PMAnderson 
I'll probably submit it to deletion review later.  
Please let me know.  PMAnderson 

I still see an overwhelming majority at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hectagon for delete, merge or redirect, which is consensus that Wikipedia does not need these as separate articles. Pilotguy is right that there is no consensus between these alternatives, but that's chiefly whether it's worth keeping the article histories. 

I do not see any suggestion of Mediation, but I would be willing to accept it; I would expect  the mediator to tell you the same thing.

These articles consisted of a dictionary definition of the alleged term as an n-sided polygon, and a diagram of a regular n-gon.
I have no objection to having the diagram of a 100-gon added to Polygon; I wouldn't do it myself because I don't think it adds anything to the article; it's barely distinguishable from a circle; but I won't contest it. 
I will object, remove, or mark as dubious any use I see of Hectagon. It's a non-word, use rarely and in error; it is used much more often as a misspelling of Hexagon or Heptagon.
One of the articles also had a sentence about Michelob using a 30-sided prism as a beer can. I doubt this will add anything to Polygon either; it belongs it Prism (geometry), but I"

My understanding is that Pascal was a much better producer than he was a director. I'm pretty sure I read that it was Shaw who urged him to direct also after Pygmalion, feeling Pascal ought to have total control. But Pascal's style of directing appears to be to work with actors and editors in making directing decisions  for instance getting director Anthony Asquith
and actor Leslie Howard to direct Pygmalion, and working with editor David Lean and actor/director Harold French to assist on Major Barbara. I don't think this style was a secret. The directing talent behind Pygmalion was decidedly Anthony Asquith, who went on to direct another Shaw play """"The Doctor's Dilemma"""" in 1958, another success, showing it was his magic that turned Shaw's plays into cinema more than Pascal. Pascal's success was to gain the trust of Shaw and get him to grant concetions on the script. It was probably a mistake for him to direct """"Caesar and Cleopatra"""" alone, most likely at Shaw's urging, as he didn't really have the director's skill so much as the art of the deal. But he was so afraid of losing Shaw that he most likely agreed to take total control to please Shaw. Sadly, had he kept Asquith, all his later attempts might have succeeded. Far from the megalomania that he is sometimes portrayed as, Pascal appears to have enjoyed deep collaboration, both with the playright, the directors, and the actors. Shaw came to think of Pascal as such a genius that he probably pushed him too far.  """

I only asked you if you blame Poland for all German losses. I did not claim knowledge of you mine. There are of course Soviet faults but in total is some 80% of Germans.

>You are a petty nationalist (I would even say borderline racist) who tries to skew everything to make Poland look like the victim of history.

Call me as you want. I call my self as patriot. If Poland was victim of history? Well much more then Germany, more then Russia, more then Belgium etc. We were just between two major powers of Europe in the corridor, flat territory where all goes back and forth. This is the difference between Canada and Poland. Its geographical location. You should think about it.

>Poland is a nation that does not matter on the world stage. GET OVER IT,

No comments. Do you love anything, maybe you only love is dollar?

>don't keep trying to blame others/make excuses for Poland's failure. you can try to blame Germans/Germany for Poland's misfortune,

Do you mean forgot the blood which was bloodshed. You do not know what you talking about. It should be never forgotten just for the sake of future generations. In Germany still Nazi party exists.

>but her own leaders did not act to Poland's best interests in the situation, and that is why what happened happened.

What happened? The II WW? Anyway do you believe Canadian leaders doing good job? It is only shallow impression because some economic prosperity.

>If Poland's own rulers hadn't of weakened her before the partitions, the partitions wouldn't of been successful, end of story.

Yes, democratic countries are weak. Poland was in some sense democratic country (less then USA of that days).
Possibly if you know the constitution 1791 was the second on the world, just after USA. Beside role of “Solidarity” in last century it indicates something. Any way my impression is you know little about Europe history. There a lot of small countries which participation is important.

>asking someone """"are you a Nazi?"""" implies that you think they are. I don't know about in Poland, but when we meet a new person in the English world we don't automatically ask them """"are you a Nazi?""""

It was not automatically in the case of so many German arrogant. It was only an example in conversation with you. It was not a personal question. You to often exaggerate.

> and finally I don't care how or why Poland is suffering!

That is bad. You show many consideration how poorly German were treated expelled from Poland. Now you show no respect to the death in concentration camps. Just beautiful. I could not expect anything more. Now: Are you Nazi?

>I asked for a reference and got it, that is all that was needed. not some lecture from a crusading nationalist who likes to dabble in historical revision (but its more like historical denial)

For sure I need not lecture from you how I should treat my fatherland. Also I need not lecture how to treat German revisionism. I am not revisionist I accept the present borders of Poland ))), I do not look for revision. You do.

>The Potsdam agreement was not a binding agreement, and it never gave the land to Poland, it gave them temporary administration over the lands,

It is you interpretation check the American, British and other atlases. Give me the “temporary” proof if you can.

>and using that administration they expelled and murdered millions of Germans,

millions? Do not be funny. Murdered maybe accidentally a few, it could happened because the post war disorder. After the war, what was German fault anyway. Millions you are absolute arrogant, where came from the number. You will have to apologize I am sure. In total was 3 millions how many death. Such number you are perfect crazy in XIX century Trucks did kill 1.5 million Armenians and we know it and after WW II in center of Europe MILLIONS of Germans. I have no words on you insolence. You will apologize it in bold big font on first line of the discussion or I will publicize you all around the World.

Cichlid
It is exactly what I explained in history: If someone removes a sentence, that person also has to deal with associated refereces. People can't just remove a sentence and leave the reference, as it does not directly support the claim it now is associated with. First what the cichlid article said initially, then what it said after the removal (the part in green is what the 1st reference directly supports; the part in red is what the 2nd reference directly supports):

 The actual number of species is therefore unclear, with estimates varying between 1300 and 3000 species, and one source suggesting 1900 species.

 The actual number of species is therefore unclear, with estimates varying between 1300 and 3000 species,.
[ref's:]

Disregarding the minor problem of the people removing the sentence missing the """"comma, full stop"""" issue in the end of this section, it is obviously very problematic to have a refence associated with a sentence it doesn't directly support. This is even more problematic in an article that has had as many problems as this has, where an IP for a long period (years, literally) continuously changed the number of estimated species while absolutely unwilling to provide a reference in support of the various claims (this has been discussed numerous times, e.g. here, here, elsewhere on talk of cichlid, and on talk of WP:AQF). Finally, after several bans and protections of the article, a number was agreed upon and a reference supporting it was located (Stiassny et al, 2007 - first of the two ref's in the above). So, if any sentence in this article needs exact referencing, this would be it. With my 2nd revert and edit summary I assumed later editors would notice the problem and deal with it. Regardless, now I've dealt with it. 212.10.78.109  """

Berkshires,

Perhaps you say that you agree with the quoted statement, but you don't seem to get it.

Yes it is true that the Beth Din will not/didn't decide who is or should be a Rebbe to whom. They never took that power to themselves nor can I imagine that such power can even be granted. But of course they were granted the power to decide who is the """"Bobover Rebbe"""", who can use the name Bobov.

Berkshires this is an obvious distinction, one that I previously thought you were faking ignorance of. I now realise that you may have very well been serious. I will therefore try to explain it in more detail.

Think for a moment, if Rabbi Halberstam should decide tommorow that he no longer wants the title Bobover Rebbe, he no longer wants he Kehilla to be named Bobov, but rather some name of some other polish town. Does that render him no longer Rebbe to his Chasidim? The connection between a Rebbe and a Chossid has absolutley nothing to do with his title.

There was a dispute in Bobov over assets, over the title, and over usage of the name Bobov and other names used by Bobov. A very simple dry Din Torah. The Beth din  gave to Rabbi Halberstam side all of Bobov assets, the rights to the title, the name Bobov, and all other names used by Bobov. That does not mean that Rabbi Unger isn't a Rebbe? It doesn't even mean that he isn't a """"mamshich"""" of his father-in-law or grandfather-in-law. The same way the first Bobover Ruv did not have the title Sanzer ruv but he was still a """"mamshich"""" of Sanzer Ruv.

Try to remove your emotions and be impartial and you may even understand the Beth Din's logic. I am not saying you need to agree, but perhpas if you stand back for a moment you can understand their decision.

Putting aside all claims and counter claims as to who should have been selcted as the Rebbe of Bobov, I know you must believe that the son-in-law should have been selected, however there is almost unanimous consent between all Poskim that the will of the majority is respected. The Beth Din made a clear finding within the Psak that Side 2 had a majority.

If you follow that logic the Psak is self explanatory. You have a Kehilla. They made a decision as to their Rav and Rebbe. A minority is unhappy. They leave. Can they get a part of the assets? Can they use the name and title? The Beth Din answered that question with its ruling.

I went long here only because I feel a sort of denialist anger simmering within your writting, and I don't think it is warranted. I thought perhaps you can follow the logic.

In any event the Beth din did make a decsion who has and can use the title Bobover Rebbe. Rabbi Unger can no longer refer to himself as Bobover Rebbe. 

It would be appropriate for you to give this a rest.  """

 Referencing 

I'm beginning to feel that the improved article would benefit from using the """"sfn"""" template refs. The advantage of these is that they allow precise page numbers to be used for each ref, but at the cost of an extra click being required to get through to the full ref, and any online text of it. The majority of the refs here need updating, and there is an excellent set of very recent papers (several above etc). Some are long and cover large parts of the subject: eg Wolfgang et al. """"Recent Progress..."""" is 24 pages of text, really too long to refer to without page numbers. Equally one doesn't want to clutter up the references section with the full title details up to 20 times.  

I must say I've never used the sfn templates before, though I normally prefer plain short footnotes for the reasons above. See Help:Overview_of_referencing_styles#Shortened_footnotes here for an explanation of how they work.

Recently, epitestosterone and the T/E ratio have received a great deal of attention in the press, and given that the upswing of endocrine research on homosexuals started with a paper that found significantly lowered excretion of testosterone and epitestosterone in homosexual men, the GLBT community should be aware of this research (see Endocrine Function in Male and Female Homosexuals, Loraine et al. 1970; and Sex Hormones and Male Homosexuality, Meyer-Bahlburg 1977)."

If you are going to insert a NPOV header on the page, you are supposed to justify all and every point you have in mind, not completely smash up a page, and then rewrite it with no discussion or debate as a Watchtower PR exercise. Many others here have covered these issues over and over and the page has been approved by two administrators in regard to the eschatology section. My edits were reverting, not altering the main text sections. I only edited the last 1995 bit, and you've said nothing about that, except made unfounded claims. All major changes are supposed to be discussed first, and you have not done that, you have just ripped out the factual material and done a whitewash edit in apologist speak to look like it was all a minor dream or something.

A couple of points I will pick up on were where you claimed in regard to 1799, 1914, 1920, and 1925 etc., that they were “suggestive and purely speculative”, but Ben, not one of those dates falls into your apologist descriptions, you are clearly not being reasonable, rational, or honest

You then say “Progressive adjustments of understanding in the face of unfolding events, resulted in a period of changing explanations centered around the years 1914, 1918, 1920, and 1925.” That is also incorrect because those dates were only changed after their humiliating failure, not before. It hardly takes a brain surgeon to change a prediction, where the world is still looking on, long after the end was supposed have arrived! You also are trying to use very deceitful terminologies to try and pacify the facts to more and more insignificance, when they were anything but that at their times of publishing. An example of your gross dishonesty is here where you say “Other dates variously considered being time of God's judgement”. Since when were they “variously considered”? They forcefully stated, “we affirm that, Scripturally, scientifically, and historically, present-truth chronology is correct beyond a doubt. Its reliability has been abundantly confirmed. . .” and “This chronology is not of man, but of God. Being of divine origin and divinely corroborated, present-truth chronology stands in a class by itself, absolutely and unqualifiedly correct.” What you inserted was gross fabrication and deceit Ben. Why? What is your agenda? If you are embarrassed, get over it. You should not destroy, whole pages due to your religious ties to the JWs.

Ben, you said “They do not profess to be inspired”, but they use ever synonym in the book that directly implies that exact same thing, see quotes here 1 and here 2, why are you hiding this balance?

There are a lot more points that you are misleading and censoring for your own agenda, and that is not the purpose of Wikepedia. I get the impression you are possibly a naïve JW who does not know about the real history of your religion (please don’t take offence at this, it is a common thing), and so you edit in good faith that your indoctrinated info from the watchtower org is correct. Please do some detailed research before you vandalise many editors' hard work. Wikepedia is here for accurate information, be it good or bad, but not public relations platform for religious groups and their biases.

You assume a lot. I don't """"support Storms,"""" it's not personal. Storms is reliable source of a kind that requires caution: he is clearly affiliated with cold fusion research. However, who should write a book on the topic? Someone who has no experience with it? Storms isn't simply editorializing, expressing his opinions, he shows the basis for those opinions with meticulously referenced text. As with any review of the field, he cites research according to his opinion of what is relevant, and this, then, gives us a guide to what is notable in the field. There are thousands of peer-reviewed papers on cold fusion, and even more  much more  if we allow conference papers. He can use conference papers, we can't, but if he cites them, that makes them sufficiently notable for our reference. Because of the position of the field as to """"general opinion""""  very unclearly defined  we have to present everything in the field as controversial, including what is quite well-established, such as excess heat. If you don't think excess heat is reasonably well-established, you should read the 2004 DoE review again, and I could cite reliable sources that the work is sound. The claim that it's all junk research, quite simply, can't be supported from any solid source, only from what are, really, tertiary sources as Hipocrite is now using at the article, in place of the much stronger Storms reference, which is a secondary source. It's like the media reports that Fleischmann's work was never replicated.

In fact, the core claim, that excess heat was found when setting up highly-loaded palladium deuteride, has been confirmed over and over. The original radiation claims were bogus. The research finding neutrons at moderate levels was bogus, artifact and error. The claim that the origin is nuclear, and in particular that it is """"fusion,"""" is unproven. In other words, OCMV, I'm quite with the 2004 DOE review, except that the field has shifted since then, the evidence for nuclear effect is stronger, a clear and consistent pattern has emerged from a review of all the research, such that negative replications typically, now, can be seen as confirmations of a general hypothesis forming, but no clear proof that the basic process is fusion.

For example, the SPAWAR group shows energetic neutrons. The work is solid and published. Aspects of it have been confirmed, and I am, indeed, assuming that there will be more confirmation; their work, over almost twenty years, has been quite solid and conservative, they've done proper controls, etc. The levels, however, are very low, and this kind of phenomenon has always been used as an argument against cold fusion: there are all these apparently contradictory experiments. I was just reading yesterday one protest that """"all these experiments produce different amounts of heat, how come there is no consistency?"""" """"So what if you find neutrons, this is inconsistent with the reported heat.""""

Actually, it isn't. What that shows is that neutrons aren't involved in whatever is generating the heat, but that the energy source, what I call the black box, is capable of creating conditions where a little hot fusion takes place. For example, take the Be-8 hypothesis. That will generate energetic alphas at 23.8 MeV. These can cause some hot fusion to take place at a low level, indeed, it would be expected. The alphas are found, confirmed, Miles et al's work showed, way back, that helium generation is correlated with excess heat. No excess heat, no helium. Excess heat, helium, in an amount proportional to the excess heat, and the ration is at 25 +/- 5 MeV, as reported by Storms and others. Krivit thinks this is a bogus figure, but I'm not convinced that Krivit understands the problem. If you don't capture all the helium, you will get a higher figure, and that is, indeed, what is found, but with some experiments, great care has been exercised to detect all the helium, and that gets us tightly toward the expected figure from d-d helium fusion, 23.8 MeV.

One writer put this way: Fleischmann didn't just discover some isolated island, that could be specified by simple coordinates, he found an entire continent, and those who try to find the island find different things, their reports vary all over the map, literally. We do not know to what extent low-energy nuclear reactions are possible. Storms details a list of observations that it would be desirable for a CF theory to explain. This does not mean that he thinks all these findings are artifact-free.

Elemental transformation under conditions that produce the excess heat phenomena is now quite well confirmed, overall. The field suffers from a lack of highly specific confirmation; this results from the conditions under which the work has been done. Researchers don't want to, at this point, waste their time doing exactly what everyone else has done, they want to"

I agree with you that Mansfield probably wouldn't object to the label. He's willing to write a book about manliness, after all! ) But I don't think I'm being oversensitive. I've seen a concerted effort by numerous editors on the Wikipedia to stigmatize various Bush administration officials, and it often involves linking together Leo Strauss, neoconservatism, and the War in Iraq. At one time, I thought the Wikipedia guideline on biographies of living persons required that the subject of articles """"publicly identify with the belief in question"""" (at least I thought it did although I can't find the relevant passage now) and I assumed that's why the comment in the article said """"Mansfield has self identified as a Straussian."""" So when I downloaded the interview and it turned out that it did not substantiate the claim, I changed the language without changing the substance. There are so many conspiracy theories out there about Leo Strauss and the War in Iraq (see G-hits for the search terms [""""Leo Strauss"""" War Iraq]) that I tend to be vigilant with notable students of Leo Strauss, since the word """"Straussian"""" has been highjacked by critics and used pejoritively.

What is useless to the article is anecdotal evidence such as a group of kids singing a song or some guy who made some Obama votives. As for singing, one should keep in mind that for many years candidates would have campaign songs written about them, naming them specifically, so a song about Obama is really nothing new.

Where are all the Franconians gone?

I remember that there are not only Low Franconian dialects (related to Dutch), but Rhine Franconian dialects spoken in Hesse, Rhineland-Palatinate and Luxembourg e. g. and Main Franconian dialects spoken in northern Bavaria. Because it is not true, Bavarian Dialects are spoken in the Nuremberg area!

I MUST object to this. When I originally put forth my version of MastCell and Nightscream's """"argument"""", I was told I was not addressing the article, but just babbling on the issue. So, I defended myself that this is directly related to the article and its POV. Then, I was told, that somehow paraphrasing the argument used to push POV is somehow an """"attack"""" on the editors!! And that I """"misattributed"""" them. Fine, I'll deal with that later. Okay, so let me get this straight. People push a POV on an article. They use specific arguments to justify pushing their POV (the endless bickering over """"scientific consensus"""", """"scientific community"""", """"facts"""", """"who is a scientist"""", just read the last 3 years' discussion pages). I come onto this discussion page, and I point out how pathetic their arguments used to push their POV are. When I do this, I am told I am """"not addressing the article to improve it"""", and that I'm """"attacking the editors"""" (!!) and that if I continue to do this, I will be banned. Whatever. Nightscream said: """"I made none of the """"arguments"""" you attributed to me, nor do I recall MastCell doing so either."""" But you said: """"It indicates that it is referring exclusively to those who follow the Scientific Method, and not any ol' Tom, Dick and Harry with a contrary opinion and a webpage."""" It does not take a ph.d. to figure out that by """"any ol' Tom, Dick, and Harry with a contrary opinion and a webpage"""" you mean Duesberg, Perth, David Crowe, AIDS Wiki, and Virusmyth, and all the people associated with them. Hence, by your own words, you are saying that all these people, the """"Tom, Dick, and Harry""""'s, are not following the """"scientific method"""" and are thus not part of your """"scientific community"""". And this is my point. You DEFINE anyone who rejects the hypothesis as necessarily not following scientific method, hence not a member of the scientific community, then claim there's 100% or near 100% agreement in the scientific community that HIV causes AIDS.

In this case, the moon's gravitational influence becomes stronger, and the earth's disappears, even though the moon orbits the earth, it's the moon's gravity that is having an effect on the spacecraft when it reaches a certain point in space.

Essex, Vermont as a City
Hi, thanks for your note. As I understand it its a municiple, political difference. City status doesn't automaticly come with size. This is clearer in the UK where there has to be a cathedral, a university and other factors (such as population size), then the Queen grants """"city"""" status. Here in the US I think its a little less rigorous, but the State grants the city """"status"""" if the town and state desire. I'm not sure what that status brings with it, but its likely to change the way the place is administered / financed and governed. I hope this helps  

According to the Vermont Citizens' Guide, (published by the Vermont League of Women Voters), """"The usual connotation of a city as a densely populated urban area is alien to Vermont.  Of the thirty largest local government units, only eight hold city charters and one must continue down the list to the 72nd largest community before reaching the ninth City of Vergennes with a population of 2,741 ... It is the form of government, not population, which distinguishes Vermont cities from towns.""""  Thus, it seems that something in Vermont is a city if and only if it has a city charter.

The White Tree incident
In your article concerning this incident you list that there were 2 nooses found on the tree.  However, most news websites claim there were 3 nooses (CNN and The Toronto Star)

 

 Apparently the reason some people are so eager to claim it was two nooses rather than three nooses is because traditionally, in the Klan, the hanging of three nooses stands for """"K - K - K.""""  

 The timeline published by the Jena Times—which uses much non-neutral wording—says that there were two nooses.

And, according to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my report as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page.If the reference is found to be wrong.

 Napoleon Zervas 

""""Zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the German occupation authorities surfaced"""" This quote came from Wikepedia's biography of Napoleon Zervas. Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:

Copyright © 2006 Illyrians.org.
During the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.

Chams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.

As a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.

The population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book """"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia"""", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that """"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek"""" .

The Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.

On June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.

During the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed in Gumenica, 626 persons were killed in Margellic and Parga. There were hundreds of other missing persons. In the same period, as a result of Greek massacres, acts of robbery and rapes against the Albanian population of Chameria; 2900 young and old men, 214 women, 96 children were massacred, 745 women were raped, 76 women abducted, 32 children, younger than 3 years were massacred, 68 villages were razed to the ground, 5800 houses and places of worship were burned down or destroyed. Furthermore, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region who took refuge in the Republic of Albania.

0,"""==Author's comments==

I posted the following comments on the userpage, but moved them now to this talk page with minor edits:

The following changes are suggested:

 Mark """"Requests for Adminship"""" as historical, and open the new process, """"Sysop Applications.""""
 Replace the standard three RFA questions with the six questions shown below.  
 Question 3 - how the applicant intends to use the sysop tools - is similar to old question 1. 
 Question 4, asking for the applicant's article writing experience, is based on old Question 2. 
 I have removed old question 3 about conflicts with other users.
 Questions 1 and 2 are added to establish minimum criteria.  Only one user (Lustiger.seth) who failed these criteria has become a sysop in the last several years.  Having these criteria on the application should eliminate the need for WP:NOTNOW closes to premature RFAs.
 Questions 5 and 6 are added to establish the candidate's character for honesty.  Why this wasn't done years ago after the Archtransit scandal is hard for me to understand.  Disclosure of material negative information should be expected of all applicants.
 Remove the old system of voting """"support"""", """"oppose"""", or """"neutral"""" with a reason in your vote.  Instead, vote """"support"""" or """"oppose"""" without giving a reason.  Then, if you choose to give a reason, you may comment in the """"Concerns"""" section or on the talk page of the Application.
 This change will reduce the """"pile-on"""" effect of oppose voting.  Normally, in old RFAs, support voters vote without saying much, whereas oppose voters write long comments.  The oppose votes are disorganized insofar as oppose vote number 13 may refer back to oppose votes number 2 and 6.  The cumulative effect of oppose votes with long reasons is to say """"we hate you.""""  
 The new model removes this asymmetry.  You can still oppose, but you can't say more in your oppose vote than a supporter would say in her support vote.  The cumulative effect of bare support and oppose votes is """"some of us like you, and some don't.""""  To the extent that reasons for opposing the candidate need to be explained, the voter can explain in the """"Concerns"""" section.
 No """"neutral"""" votes.  If you don't want to vote, nobody is forcing you.  Neutral votes are pointless.
 We can decide later what a passing score should be.  For now we can allow bureaucrats to use their discretion as they currently do.

The following features will be maintained from the old RFA process:
 Bureaucrats decide the outcome after a 7-day discussion.
 A nominator may praise the candidate.  That is probably the one positive aspect of old RFA that is worth preserving.

 Fixing Assange and resistance: I have preferences set to show cache pages, but """"Assange"""" also took """"18.002 secs"""" (not 0.250) for me to access, obviously bypassing cache but not edited in 3 hours, while other articles showed cache-page copies. That's another performance shock for me: one article bypasses cache. I cleared my entire browser cache, and then Assange showed the cache-page copy. As for broad resistance, the Continuous Improvement movement (Kaizen, etc.) has warned, """"People dislike change"""". Most act like the """"boiling frog"""" and sit while the temperature rises, never moving until too late and """"Beyonce"""" runs 26 seconds (or Assange 18). I advised Jimbo, to add """"More pillars"""" where Performance becomes a major priority, like Civility or NPOV, rather than """"personal preference to see results"""" in the same hour, while they demand the cite-tools still work. You might know I've had severe rejections trying to defuse essay wp:PERF, and explain how the Titanic sank because """"Don't worry"""" thwarted other people from acting or improving (the ship design included ample lifeboats rejected by others). This year, with the Costa Concordia in Italy, passengers worried enough about the tilting ship to call land-based police to complain the ship seemed damaged while crew pretended """"Don't worry"""". Enough. I think we are reaching """"critical mass"""" to move forward here. The next compromise consensus supports all parameters (as demanded pronto), and auto-runs the quick citations, with later promises to """"fix"""" {Citation/core} where possible, and still support those cite-tools which generate {cite_web} calls and such. It is a hideously complex upgrade, with over 23 forks as {cite_book}, {cite_video}, {cite_document}, {cite_press_release}, {cite_encyclopedia}, even """"{citeweb}"""" or """"{cite web}"""" but fixing the most-used will cure the speed problems. Plus, the talk-page already warns to deprecate """"surname1"""" for """"last1"""" where 3 fewer alias parameters could mean 2x faster for that parameter, perhaps next year. Beyond the complex fast {Fcite} templates, the rapid {cite_quick} runs 10x-12x faster, so """"Assange"""" can drop from 18 to 5-second edit-preview. I already saved some temporary revisions to """"prove"""" Assange can reformat in 5 seconds:
 Assange  03:32, 15 August 2012‎ Wikid77 (talk | contribs)‎ . . (126,986 bytes) (-1,526)‎ . . (undid 2nd prior revision to compare performance & confirm edit-preview returns to 18 seconds, when not using Template:Cite_quick.)

Anyone who has seen the serie, about Celia, knows that what I have written is what is shown in the serie, the Celia Cruz's life is the thread of the plot although certainly there are passages characters or fictional stories that enrich the plot, but it does not mean which I've added to the Celia (telenovela) page, is not the summary of the serie or is something false.
In the serie shown as she is an amazing woman and how she began her extraordinary career, her struggle against racism and his triumph by winning as a woman in a musical world where only men was excelled, in the series is also shows how she begins conquering the world with his unique style and powerful voice, reasons that becomes her the legitimate icon of Latinos Worldwide.

There are two FeloniousMonk's!

One must be a sockpuppet. I edited the intro to say:

The canonical definition of the Discovery Institute's Intelligent Design is that Intelligent Design (sometimes abbreviated ID) is the controversial assertion that certain features of the universe and of living things exhibit the characteristics of a product resulting from an intelligent cause or agent, as opposed to an unguided process such as natural selection. Intelligent Design is wholly a product of the Discovery Institute, a conservative Christian think tank. The idea has been around since 1990.

Just like FeloniousMonk said above:

The canonical definition of intelligent design, which is the one offered by the Discovery Institute (""""that certain features of the universe and of living things exhibit the characteristics of a product resulting from an intelligent cause or agent, as opposed to an unguided process such as natural selection"""") Since ID is wholly a product of the Discovery Institute, with every leading ID proponent is one of its Fellows and every campaign and strategy arising from its offices, defining ID as they do is necessary in the intro for any of the claims made in the article by Dembski, Behe or Johnson to make any sense. Any intro that ignores the canonical definition is deficient.

Thank you for that answer, but that's not what I asked. Have you or have you not read Mussolini's autobiography and speeches? That wasn't my question either; that's a new one. If you have, then you would know that claims of Fascism being anti-clerical is absurd (the position of individual anti-clerical self-professed Fascists is irrelevant to the ideology of Fascism itself). You would have to resort to conspiracy, as the would-be scholars have, and claim that Mussolini's ideology of Fascism was all a huge front and that he secretly was anti-Clerical and secretly considered anti-Clericalism intrinsic to Fascism. How convenient. And as for Darwinism, which was my other point, you won't find anything on that either. Mussolini never even stated anything about evolution (nor did Hitler, for that matter). Did he believe in evolution? Considering the times he lived in, probably. But he never mentioned it, let alone social Darwinism. Yet this article presents social Darwinism as if it were intrinsic to Fascism!

 Kosebamse's anti-Cubic crusade 
Kosebamse, firstly, explain how my comment regarding Cubic implications of Occam's razor was """"frivolous"""" and """"betrays the quality of your argumentation"""".

Secondly, you demand testable predictions. I will firstly point out that most theories have values other than the capacity to predict the outcome of experiments. Had relativity been formulated only after all its implications had been verified, it would still be used widely, but for such practical uses as technology development and simulation. As such, to determine a theory's practical value, we must focus on its real-life ramifications  testable hypotheses, but not necessarily predictions.

From the fundamental Cubic principles, we may broadly define manifestations of Cubic geometry evident in reality. Firstly, that everything is cyclical. In the case of large-scale phenomena, such as cyclicality of galaxy death and rebirth, and that of the universe as a whole, our observational capabilities may not suffice; but on smaller scales, cyclicality certainly is measurable.

A second observable influence is the life that has evolved on Earth, representing an interaction between chaos and Time Cube. Cubic properties are evident in lifeforms  see and Pyramidal Lifeforms, and Systems and Complexities in Nature."""

In my edit summaries, I clearly explained the removal of each of those links. Your mass rollback of those edits, without comment, is very impolite and violates Wikipedia:External links. Please read that page to understand why those links are inappropriate: An external link added to an article should provide information specifically about that article's subject. Per Wikipedia:External links, one should avoid links to 
Sites that are only indirectly related to the article's subject: the link should be directly related to the subject of the article. A general site that has information about a variety of subjects should usually not be linked to from an article on a more specific subject.

This is why, for example, we do not link to http://www.imdb.com/ in every movie article, only the subpage of imdb.com about that movie. Cf. Template:Imdb name.

Inclusion of such links into a template might be very desirable for the site's owner to maximise the SEO/page rank benefit, but please note that Wikipedia:External links explicitly discourages Links mainly intended to promote a website'' 
Please do not insert such links again, and do not make blanket reverts without addressing the arguments that other editors gave for their edits.

Find any other equivalent. You guys have changed the entire subject. The fact of the matter is that you can not call ethnic groups prior to 1919 as Azerbaijani; there was no such defined identity. Why are there articles on the Dutchy? The Dutchy were more defined as a group than were the Turkic peoples living in those lands… why not plain German? And again, Parishan is using Russian and Soviet propaganda material, which maintained such a position, including for the Turks living in Armenia, to stop Turkey's expansionism… they had Turks in Nakhichevan and those in Armenia rather to adhere to an Azerbaijani identity than Turkish. But prior to the Soviet rules, those people were not identifying themselves, neither were they identified as such. I am wondering how much more can Parishan provide other than Soviet-Russian historiography which was known to be tainted when covering ethnic groups and ethno genesis, turning ethnic groups into groups that all originated from the identities forming the Union, some sort of Self-Sufficient system. This process already started during the end of the Russian Empire, Roy writes: In Azerbaijan for a brief period (the governorate of Vorontsov in the 1850s, and that of Goltsyn from 1896 to 1905), the Russians encouraged the development of an Azeri identity in order to weaken links with Iran and Turkey (The New Central Asia The Creation of Nations by Olivier Roy I.B.Tauris, (2000) p.56)

During the process, many different groups were pushed into being identified as ethnically Azerbaijani, including Kurds, who haven't until recently when groups wanted their independence requested their identity to be changed: In 1988 some 10,000 Kurds in Azerbaijan returned their Azeri identity papers to Moscow with the explicit request that their identity be changed from Azeri to Kurd. (A Modern History of the Kurds by David McDowall, I.B.Tauris (2004), p.493)

And to use Parishan’s opening, it is funny how Parishan is requesting sources for those quotes, Ulvi were you not a participant on the arbitration enforcement? How many sources were used? Parishan has probably missed references like this: In 1897 'Tatars'-which officially included most Muslim groups... (Socialism in Georgian Colors: The European Road to Social Democracy, 1883-1917, Harvard University Press (2005) p. 19)

Here, another quote missed by Parishan: In Contrast with the Armenians, the Azerbaijani national identity is very recent. In fact, the very name """"Azerbaijani"""" was not widely used until the 1930s; before that, Azerbaijani intellectuals were unsure whether they should call themselves Caucasian Turks, Muslims, Tatars or something else.  (S.Kaufmann, Modern hatred, Cornell University Press, 2001. See page 56.) 

Do I need to provide what was provided and include also newer ones? I like Eupator’s request RFC about this article, and a it’s a good idea of requesting the same for several other articles. Ulvi, your English language justification makes no sense; you could have changed for Turkic people instead of making an inaccurate move. -   """

The INTERNET os an important tool to get information out there. It is the best place.

Any acts of suppression are somewhat impossible, since the physics are easy to replicate. All you need is sacred geometry (nature's geometry).

Vk (and Giano) were more than happy to have my input when he thought it would get him unblocked, but now the conditions are not to Vk's liking - despite what he agreed at the time - suddenly the accusations against me start again. What is really sad is that you seem to buy into it. 
I strongly resent your implication that I want him banned. I supported a ban in the past, true, along with many other editors. But the accusation makes absolutely no sense, considering how was already banned (twice) and both times I worked to get it lifted, this despite some atrocious personal abuse from Vk in the past.

Again, the Dom -> Rom theory is based on a supposed name connection (while there are plenty of such possibilities  of connections with words from the Subcontinent) and on a supposed connection between Domba's low status and the anti-Romani prejudices. Scientifc studies presented reasons for its' lack of substance and for the Rajput ancestry. Some supporters of Dom -> Rom reorganized later their theory, by including the points raised against its likeliness, by presenting the Ḍom as a cover-term for itinerant service-providing castes and the three group as originating in different areas within India, speaking different (albeit related) Indian languages, and probably leaving the Subcontinent at different times, taking different routes.

Asia; it holds that Turkic, Mongolian and Tungusic
(Manchu-Tungusic), together comprising some forty
languages, are genetically related. More extended
versions of the Altaic hypothesis would include Korean
and Japanese, sometimes also Ainu. Various scholars in
the early and mid 1800s proposed classifications that
would group some or all of the ‘Altaic’ languages
together, but typically these were included in larger, more
poorly defined proposed affiliations, such as the now
abandoned Ural-Altaic hypothesis.(p.7)

Now abandoned is Ural-Altaic relation which was replaced with , not Altaic.

 TIBIN VARGHESE (CREATED BY) Hypertension  

Hypertension
 
Hypertension is a disorder characterized by consistently high blood pressure. Generally, high blood pressure consists of systolic blood pressure (the """"top"""" number, which represents the pressure generated when the heart beats) higher than 140, or diastolic blood pressure (the """"bottom"""" number, which represents the pressure in the vessels when the heart is at rest) over 90.

Effect on the Eyes
High blood pressure can injure the eyes, causing a condition called retinopathy
Hypertensive retinopathy
 
Damage to the retina from high blood pressure is called hypertensive retinopathy. It occurs as the existing high blood pressure changes the microvasculature of the retina. Some of the first findings in the disease are flame hemorrhages and cotton wool spots. As hypertensive retinopathy progresses, hard exudates can appear around the macula along with swelling of the macula and the optic nerve, causing impairment of vision. In severe cases permanent damage to the optic nerve or macula can occur.
Bone Loss
Hypertension also increases the elimination of calcium in urine, potentially leading to loss of bone mineral density, a significant risk factor for fractures, particularly in elderly women. In one study, women with the highest levels of blood pressure lost bone density at nearly twice the rate of those in the lowest range. It is not clear whether this effect occurs in men or in non-Caucasian women.

Sexual Dysfunction
Sexual dysfunction is more common and more severe in men with hypertension and in smokers than it is in the general population. Many of the drugs that treat hypertension are thought to cause impotence as a side effect. In these cases, it is reversible when the drugs are stopped. More recent evidence suggests, however, that the disease process that causes hypertension is itself the major cause of erectile dysfunction in these men. Newer anti-hypertensive drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), are less associated with erectile dysfunction. ARBs, such as losartan (Cozaar), may be particularly effective in restoring erectile function in men with high blood pressure. Sildenafil (Viagra) is successful in achieving erections in almost two-thirds of patients with controlled high blood pressure. Because sildenafil has a shorter half-life and is eliminated more quickly from the body than newer erectile dysfunction drugs, it may be a safer option for men with hypertension. In a 2003 review of safety data, sildenafil did not appear to pose a risk for men who had both high blood pressure and erectile dysfunction.
Pregnancy and Preeclampsia
Severe, sudden high blood pressure in pregnant women is one component of a condition called preeclampsia (commonly called toxemia) that can be very serious for both mother and child. Preeclampsia occurs in up to 10% of all pregnancies, usually in the third trimester of a first pregnancy, and resolves immediately after delivery. Other symptoms and signs of preeclampsia include protein in the urine, severe headaches, and swollen ankles.
This condition may be caused by a failure of the placenta to embed properly in the uterus, which causes it to misconnect with the mother's blood vessels. As a result, the fetus does not receive a sufficient blood supply, and the mother's own blood pressure increases to replace it.

The reduced supply of blood to the placenta can cause low birth weight and eye or brain damage in the fetus. Severe cases of preeclampsia can cause kidney damage, convulsion, and coma in the mother and can be lethal to both mother and child.
Women at risk for preeclampsia (particularly those with existing hypertension) may benefit from having an ultrasound of uterine arteries at 20 to 24 weeks of pregnancy, followed (if abnormal) by 24-hour blood pressure monitoring.
Uterine Fibroids
High blood pressure may increase the risk of developing fibroids, according to data from the Nurses’ Health Study. Tracking women for 10 years, the prospective epidemiologic study found that for every 10 mm/Hg increase in diastolic blood pressure, the risk for developing fibroids increased by 8 - 10%.

Outlook for Children with Hypertension
Children with high blood pressure should first be treated with lifestyle changes, including weight reduction, increased physical activity, and diet modification. If blood pressure is not controlled with lifestyle changes, drug treatment may be required. Although there are few clinical trials conducted in children, a 2005 study found that the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan was safe and effective in children. Results of studies evaluating outcomes of children with hypertension suggest that early abnormalities, including enlarged heart and abnor"

Have you looked at the SSP report for Fredrick day? Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Fredrick day. He's got his own variable IP access, plus he has some wireless networks in his neighborhood. That's his IP, 99.99%. (Notice that there are two edits, different IP in the same block.) And the text is pure Fd. Look, you see IP from a certain range editing parlipro articles, you draw a certain conclusion, and you are pretty likely to be correct. The level of necessary coincidence for this to not be Fd would be astronomical. The particular interest in Sarsaparilla's edits, the mention of me, plus the first two IP fields, this is Fd. The vast majority of Fd IPs have not seen any edits before he started using them, they could probably be safely blocked ... but I'm not terribly exercised about it. I'd revert them if I thought them damaging. I hadn't looked at the other edits. I will. Anyway, thanks. And my apologies for any possible insult in what I wrote, but this whole affair has been about very selective attention. I'm seeing it happen with other editors. Once there is a pall over an editor, especially an active one, every move is scrutinized by anyone who ever had a conflict with him; one editor now, 25,000 edit level, is clearly being harassed, yet it looks like ArbComm will sanction him, not those who are harassing him. (For what? For complaining, it looks like.) We'll see.

In Sarsaparilla's case, Fd was there with one vicious personal attack after another, on AN/I, and where was the attention being put? On Sarsaparilla, for having put up an article on the Easter Bunny hotline. We don't normally indef block users for putting up a non-notable article! """"Last straw,"""" is what is said, of course.

Hello,

What comment are you refering to?

Well... a bunch of them. For instance:

You do understand that Wikipedia has thousands of articles about highly controversial topics? That's not a sufficient reason for deletion. (talk) 

That one is removed, 

(edit conflict, but pretty much agrees with above) The fourth reference is known as a secondary source, which is the kind of sources that wikipedia tries to cite. We take as little as possible from primary sources, and instead use secondary sources, verifiable secondary sources in fact. Google video is not a secondary source, nor is it a verifiable source, so any evidence gleaned from people's postings there is not permissible as evidence. Unless you can find any verifiable evidence that supports your reasoning, I'm gonna call on Occam's razor and say that the more simple explanation that fits the facts is true. Please stop trolling this page unless you have cold, hard, verifiable facts that support your thesis, as any further rants will be removed as trolling. Thank you.  

That one is modified,

This is trolling. Can we please close this, since it is obvious that Gaby de wilde is either unintrested in accepting that the majority don't buy his/her conspiricy theory, or he/she is trolling. Either way, this is pointless. If he/she thinks this page has any hope of being deleted... I must provide a phone number to a local mental hospital.  

That one is removed, and there are a bunch of others. So when you compress your own comments, please don't remove or change other people's, ok?  

And how is this a valid reason to delete my post? 

I honestly ask you: Did you even read it before you hit delete?  I removed some postings that contained only accusations of trolling. Everything I wrote so far in wikipedia has been deleted!

THANK YOU EVERYONE!

So far I have not figured out what to do about this. If you read the post you  deleted then you would know there is no link between Osama and 911.

Which means Officially there are no Muslim terrorists.

I'm not going to edit one more letter you see. I've been reverted into nothing more then enough now. All I want to know now is why you insist upon having lies like that on the wikipedia page.

You like the news media quoted as an authority over the FBI right?

At least share me your thoughts on the topic.

Or explain why it's unreasonable to ask?

 DEAR Anonymous EE Guy,

Well, I don't know if you really mean to give a full picture of the case, but we could include this one:

http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/reich1.htm

http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/

Who are the web site of Jean-Pierre Voyer, a kind of model person for mister Messager/YBM, and who spred a quiet special form for ideologie, which goal is to play with words and how to defend and argue about things who do not exist, how to play with words and """"fuck others"""" as phrased on his web site, and essentialy, how to display a superior attitude in order to effectively use the communication on internet to their full interest, by using the circumstances frame of the dialogues. This include displaying lies as being facts with such a forcefullness as to convince others. It is called: postsituationnisme, ideologie who is followed by YBM, together with a sympathie to the 3rd reich, and a, by some, called pseudo-Hégelianism. YBM run his forum where he defend the man and his positions, with as much furore as he dispells those of Igor and Grichka Bogdanov. You will found in it concepts as the Superior Race, versus the inferior race, and different creativs ways to talk the technics and language of publicity into a way of """"mass communication"""" and a weapon to convince anyone of anything.

I am sure that this angle will bring a certain shade of light where it was upmost needed, and will constitute the missing piece of the puzzle.

I hope you will excuse my very late assertion or révélation about this subject, but I was myself only made aware of it for a very short time ago, together with the fact that this Voyer and YBM have harrassed people before, writers too, for books who had nothing to do with science, but nevertheless constituted those 2 mens lifes mening for 2 years. Actually they stopped with their first victims at the end of 2002, beginning of 2003, to consacrate their cherish technics of manipulating the masses, and ideologies of diffamation on 2 other subjects, Igor and Grichka Bogdanov.

No need to say that the 2 former victims are still paying for the vices of Voyer and Messager, and that their lifes and career have been destroyed.

Why so much hate against people they didn't knew and had never met? They were only practicing, like serial killers start somewhere, in the shadow, and are only known for much more exposed actions.

Here are some other links who do compleete the picture: The first attacks of Voyer and YBM against XAVIER, the writer: http://aeamh.free.fr/x/agent.html http://aeamh.free.fr/blockhaus/ http://aeamh.free/bk/index.html

YBM Web site:

http://aeamh.free.fr
Site Voyer: http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/reich1.htm http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/

I consider this information for being central in the matter at hand, as all accusations will have fallen and nothing much will have come from the original and following J. Baez paper on the subject if it hadn't been for Messager and Voyers' questionnable work in the name of very questionnable motives, all accomplished to serve a completely useless ideology. I think that this will teach us all a lesson regarding objectivity and our hability to evaluate a given problem properly, and to be able to use our sense of sceptisisme ans sound judgement. On a more general way and even more central here, our power to distinguish between agreeing to a given opinion based on facts, and being manipulate in doing so for all the wrong reasons.

This information compleete the picture and gave it its true mening, even if it is by showing how meningsless a huge part of this affair was.

 Do you work for NAD ? 

Rammalite I looked at the changes you made to """"effect on israeli security"""" (such as this: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli_West_Bank_barrier&diff;=25180710&oldid;=25179950)

I find it interesting that arguments made in this propeganda material http://www.nad-plo.org/facts/wall/WallMagazine%207-2005.pdf (such as that the wall actually does not save lives and does not increase Israel security ) have found their way into this article.

Let me be clear:

There are two groups who don't like the wall.

The two groups are: Palestinians who are against the two state solution
Settlers who are against the two state solution

Each of these groups think, that by using force (and God) they will eventually drive the other people out.
The Palestinians who object the two setate solution and the settler all see a big problem in the wall: It creates a border, a demarcation line.

So natually, both of thse groups are trying to show that the wall is bad and not working.

WE should reresent this on this article but not in the way you have done.

Since I am sure you are not a settler but I know you are from Ramalla I wonder if you are one of those paid 20-30 researchers and PR experts in NAD ?

 Follow-up re new medal icons for medals tables 

Well, this has been finally implemented, and I think the new icons are a radical improvement over the previous color blocks.  The medals table of Nicole Haislett looks remarkably cleaner and more graphically refined, and we may now replace many of the artificially abbreviated place names and event descriptions that were previously employed to avoid line-wrapping within the medals tables.  A couple of points remain to be discussed and resolved:

  how do we handle the graphics for the """"disqualified"""" medal option?
  what do we do about the winner, runner-up and playoff options that were engrafted onto this template by an association football editor in 2011?

I'm bringing these issues here first, SFB, because you (a) are obviously not opposed to change, and (b) have a good eye for better graphics.  I would like to get on the same page with you before starting another template talk page discussion.

My suggestion for the """"disqualified"""" issue would be to fill square area surrounding the circular medal icon with a percentage screen of red, with a red diagonal bar drawn across the icon itself  that screams intuitive.  The disqualified option should also include a field for explanatory footnote text.  Another simpler alternative is to omit disqualified medals altogether.

As for the winner, runner-up and playoffs options for association football/soccer, I seriously question whether these should be included in a """"medals"""" table at all.  Having looked at several dozen footballer infoboxes that use these options, it also appears that many uses are for minor regional, national and subnational tournaments.  Frankly, I wonder if WP:FOOTY has even sanctioned many of these minor tournament outcomes for inclusion; most of them do not appear to be medal competitions, so the use of the gold, silver and bronze background colors is inaccurate.

I could make the issue a little more complicated though: Graphic equalizer (not yet written), Smiley face curve, Parametric equalization, and British EQ all have to do with what I'll call """"Music equalization"""" (for lack of a better term). This includes sections 1 and 2 of the current Equalization filter  along with possible future articles tone controls, loudness control (combine with Smiley face), speaker equalization etc. Oh, I'm certainly not saying that these need to be separate articles, but could as well be topics in one article (except that a few of these already exist separately). The article should mention that """"equalization"""" is a misnomer (but has become the accepted term) since these are typically used to modify the tone to suit someone's taste, not strictly to compensate for a channel's frequency response.

Then there should be an article which discusses actual channel equalization (or some such term) which WOULD include section 3 of Equalization filter (Telecommunications lines), RIAA equalization, FM pre/de-emphasis as well as equalization of non-audio channels; this is the orginal meaning of """"equalization""""). Such equalizers are generally non-adjustable (by a user, at least) and transparent to the end user. So I call it a different subject, even when it IS audio. Anyway, I don't have much time to deal with this nor am I the best person to write about the specialized issues regarding either professional audio or channel equalization problems.

0,"""==Why I don't edit often anymore==

Back in the day I used to edit wikipedia on a fairly regular basis. One of the pages I edited was the eXile. One detractor of the eXile, Peter Ekman, was so pathologically obsessed with discrediting the periodical, that he would devote weeks at a time to blanking and otherwise vandalizing the eXile article while launching reckless accusations at everyone who """"defended"""" the eXile. Although many editors did our best to contain Mr. Ekman, eventually he wore me down. It just wasn't worth it spending my free time containing the vendetta of some aggrieved middle-aged jerk.

As a parting bow in my too-long Ekman drama, I wanted to post here a summary about Mr. Ekman's character and the original wiki text that prompted Mr. Ekman's crusade.

About Peter Ekman

Peter Ekman is the aforementioned hack journalist who crusaded against the eXile. But once upon a time Ekman actually had an impressive sounding job working as an editor for the Moscow Times and dispensing right-wing platitudes in the heart of the former communist empire. Moscow in the 90s was a place where failures didn't fail. And for a long time Ekman didn't fail, despite his total lack of social graces and limited intelligence. Eventually his columns attracted the ire of the fellow Moscow publication, the eXile.

Originally the eXile was planning only on criticizing Ekman's written work, but Ekman's response was righteous, menacing, and hinted at violence. So the eXile's added a personal detail: they included the account of a female employee who had been subjected to unwelcome sexual advances by Mr. Ekman. Mr. Ekman had groped the employee while inviting her to a weekend get-away while his Russian Bride was out of town. Ekman responded with the same witless ape-shit animosity that I have since personally witnessed many times on wikipedia. Ekman attempted to get the eXile banned from Johnson's Reading List by declaring the eXile was a fascist, neo-nazi periodical. Ekman's evidence for such nazi sympathies was a spoof fashion piece entitled """"The eXile's Third Reich Uniform of the Week,"""" in which a fictional gay fashion designer breathlessly reviewed the 1938 version of the Nazi Field Bishop uniform.

Eventually Ekman lost his position at the Moscow Times. Since then he's occasionally surfaced as a professor of finance at various 3rd rate universities and, of course, here on Wikipedia.

The following is an excerpt from the Wikipedia Article on the eXile that prompted Mr. Ekman's crusade:

Peter Ekman, Johnson's Russia List, and an Unsubtantiated Groping Allegation
In November 2000, in Issue #23 of The eXile, Matt Taibbi published a press review entitled Peter Ekman Groped Me.  The article ridiculed Ekman, then newly appointed editor of The Moscow Times, for his approach to the economic and political development of Russia.  Taibbi characterized this approach as high-handed, condescending, and arrogant, and went on to mock Ekman personally as a pompous hypocrite: """"Ekman has only one idea (""""Russia has a lot to learn from America""""), which he tries endlessly to sell and resell as a varied package of ribald wit and insight.""""  The article also ridiculed Ekman for describing himself as a """"financial educator,"""" and described him as having """"a head seemingly worn bald from improper use.""""  As a finishing touch, Taibbi recounted an as-yet unverified account of sexual advances made by Ekman to an eXile employee, made at late at night at the Garazh nightclub in Moscow during a visit from Ekman's mother-in-law.

Ekman responded by writing in to Johnson's Russia List to claim that """"the eXile is fascist and racist,""""  that """"every eXile issue contains unverifiable stories that smear someone's reputation,"""" that The eXile """"is associated with the fascist party of Eduard Limonov."""" The accusations of fascism were discounted by many in part because of the eXile's Jewish roots - Ames, along with the eXile's publisher, deputy editor and several contributors are all Jews - and because of the paper's satirical editorial bent. It remains unclear as to whether Ekman did in fact make advances toward an eXile employee, or who that employee may have been.

Proposed paragraphs
""""Option 1"""" below shows the two paragraphs he (Hafen) is proposing. Now that I have read the Wiki guidelines suggested to me here and in other places, I can see that this might not fly. But I need to be able to tell him I tried with the text he suggested. I have another idea for a different approach that might be more acceptable (see option 2mine,  after option 1his). I would like your feedback.

Current: (to be replaced) Hafen denies that there is a biological link to sexual orientation, stating that same-sex attraction is """"not in your DNA"""". He says that the American Psychological Association was politically motivated to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders.

Option 1:
As a Professor of Law at BYU from 1973-1996, his teaching and research focused on family law and education law, with particular interests in the legal rights of children and in the legal status of marriage.  A sample of his scholarly articles includes publications in the Harvard Law Review, Harvard International Law Journal, Michigan Law Review, Duke Law Journal, Ohio State Law Journal, and the American Bar Association Journal. Two of his articles were cited in opinions of the U.S. Supreme Court. He has been an invited speaker at professional conferences on family, education, and constitutional law in a variety of international and domestic locations.

In a 2009 speech in Utah, Hafen spoke to Evergreen International, a support group for people who desire to overcome their own same-gender attraction. A portion of his remarks summarized “the secular case against same-gender marriage.” He cited the 2006 decision of the French parliament rejecting gay marriage so that children “do not suffer as a result of situations imposed on them by adults.  The interest of the child must outweigh the exercise of freedom by adults, whatever life choices are made by the parents.”  He also stated that same-sex attraction is “not in your DNA,” observing that while “inherited susceptibilities” and “natural personality traits do influence one’s inclinations” toward same-gender attraction, the “idea that there is a ‘gay gene’” that determines gender attraction “has little scientific support.”  He stated that the gay rights movement represents “an aggressive political movement” more than it represents “substantive change in the medical or legal evidence.”  For example, he said, the decision of the American Psychological Association to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 1973 came from “putting the issue to an open vote in their professional meetings—not because of any change in actual medical findings.” 

Option 2
In a 2009 speech in Utah, Hafen spoke to Evergreen International, a support group for people who desire to overcome their own same-gender attraction. His address generated a wide range of responses and was reported on in Salt Lake City's two major newspapers: the Salt Lake Tribuneand the Deseret News.
(I was thinking/hoping this would be neutral, because the Tribune gave a less-than-favorable report and the Deseret News gave a more favorable report. Referencing the two could offer some balance.)

If there is a genus under anther code with the same name, then we do indeed use different disambiguators, but where there is only one, """" (genus)"""" is by far the best disambiguator.

""""Holmia (genus)"""" is the most predictable, most straightforward and broadest disambiguator; I have thought about it a lot, and I am firmly convinced that this is the best way to disambiguate articles on biological taxa.
Some of your other questions should be answered at WP:DAB (especially WP:DABNAME).

Well from the offerings you have made on your wiki, blog and elsewhere, you would certainly be a gem of an editor here. Your comments on the 10 commandments to save world fisheries and your notion of a Pacific Islands Fisheries Management Index move in directions I think the Wikipedia articles should. It's true that Wikipedia is more anonymous and constrains, in that you cannot present original research, but must instead back up statements with verifiable sources. It is an encyclopedia, so the encyclopediac game must be played. But still, that doesn't have to be that constraining, and Wikipedia has many advantages. The demand to be encyclopediac can often help cut through bull shit and starkly clarify where new research is needed. Important current issues that cannot be adequately sourced can still be discussed in the talk pages, and strategies can be developed so they may eventually get appropriate external sources. Well structured articles will be here to stay. They can have modest starts, but if properly framed will lend themselves to incremental improvements over time. Your articles need not drop off the edge of the blogosphere or disappear into the limbo of deceased wikis. They will have far more traffic and outreach than blogs or personal wikis can ever have. The traffic should increase with time. And of course you can still personally invite collaborators. An article on Pacific Islands Fisheries could be set up as a start to your index project, and a very nice article it could be too. We could work it up to FA. I think """"commandments"""" for sustainable fisheries is probably the single most important topic in the Fisheries and Fishing WikiProject, and I'm sure we could eventually get that humming nicely in attention grabbing but encyclopediac ways across a number of articles.

Clearly Wiki is the entity the community have made it and although the views and actions expressed don't seem consistent with many of the sentiments on the founders page such as objectivism etc that is the Wiki we have. There is no prospect other than repetition of this issue as new invigilators come and go.
I can't see the merit of taking the stance expressed with an individual contributor such as myself. The website domain you may consider blacklisting is the one used by Wiki by association to validate copyright ownership of the materials I provide.
The issue with all those images is that everyone of them contravenes a strict interpretation of the self-interest policy as the licence for use requires attribution including my domain.
For this reason they must all be removed from wiki. Furthermore as the copyright holder I'm withdrawing permission for their use and display by Wiki and request their deletion. I'm assuming you have a bot or similar that can do so efficiently.

This is ludicrous.  20:15, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)

I agree entirely.  However, it is no more ludicrous than splitting Walsall or Dudley.   20:26, Mar 3, 2004 (UTC)

There are some good reasons to split district articles from their town.  They include (a) if the district is much larger than the town, and covers a lot of countryside (b) if the district includes town which have a strong identity.  That the borough/district is a city is not a good reason, because city status is a mere honorific and doesn't change facts on the ground.  If we split Dudley and Walsall we have to split Birmingham, Coventry, and Wolverhampton.  Note I am opposed to all splits of articles about metropolitan boroughs.   20:32, Mar 3, 2004 (UTC)

Nice to see this one's been reunified. It seems (seemed) a bit more ludicrous than spliiting Walsall (town) form Walsal (Borough) because there was nothing to indicate that Wolverhampton (city) contained more than Wolverhampton (town). I guess you were just making a point, and it doesn't.

I think the articles should be split on the basis of how much we've got to say about the two definitions. If we've only got a few lines about one it can live with the other.

I was indeed making a point, though it seems to have been missed.  If we look at Birmingham, say, the city includes Sutton Coldfield but the 'town' does not!   This, however, does not mean to say we should split the article.  I know that someone from Bradford said that Bradford shouldn't be split, even though Bradford is a far far clearer case for splitting than Dudley.   20:53, Mar 3, 2004 (UTC)

Wiki on Wolverhampton is 100x better than it was a year ago...

 Sport 

Wolverhampton Wanderers have never been in the current UEFA Champions League competition.  Wolves have only been in the English F.A. Premiership for one season (2002/03) since the Champions League began, and in that season they were relegated back to the lower-division Coca-Cola Championship.

The current Champions League competition only started in the 1992/93 season, the premier European club tournament before the Champions League was the European Champions Club Cup in which Wolves did compete in.

 

In fact, the UEFA Champions' League was a simple rebrand of the previous competition - which was created due to the European success of Wolverhampton Wanderers, and the reaction of the British press to the results. 

To quote from European_Cup_and_Champions_League_History: """"Before we declare that Wolverhampton are invincible, let them go to Moscow and Budapest. And there are other internationally renowned clubs: A.C. Milan and Real Madrid to name but two. A club world championship, or at least a European one - larger, more meaningful and more prestigious than the Mitropa Cup and more original than a competition for national teams - should be launched."""" - Gabriel Hanot

What exactly is the remit of the article?  After all, there are several definitions of what Wolverhampton is.

The Local Authority area administered by Wolverhampton City Council.
The Wolverhampton Urban Sub-Area as defined by the ONS (or the """"city proper"""", perhaps?)  This include the LA area, plus the areas within South Staffordshire district that are physically attached (within 50m) to the urban area.  These would include Lower Penn, Perton, Coven Heath, Westcroft and Essington.
The above, plus areas that are within a few hundred metres of the Urban Area - such as Wombourne, Codsall, Bilbrook, Coven, Featherstone.  Most of these areas were recommended for inclusion in the Borough by the"

I happen to be from Ontario and in Ontario the Regions are spending many Billions of dollars on public tenders each year inviting only a few friends and keeping all others from getting their work or making money from their work if they get one. The few invited friends are mostly companies who could not compete in open tender and can only get the work from taking non-elected public officials golfing and god knows what else. All that is evident is that public works cost up to 100% or more than it should and they are not subject to Auditor General control.

The history section seems to be a little heavy on the subsections, and some of those could be combined. Some of the subsections overall could have shorter and more concise titles as well. There are a good number of photos in the article, which is good, but they seem to be cluttered over on the right side of the article, and should probably be placed a bit more evenly. Also, many of the image captions are very, and should be shortened as well. Photo captions, as a rule, shouldn't really introduce any new content to the article, and should be brief enough to simply describe the photo they're attached to. All photos should also be relevant to the article text and sections that they are placed in as well, with some sort of text in the main article discussing it.

 Discussion moved from Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Doctor Who 

I know you're all probably sick to your back teeth of hearing about it, but considering how we have just changed the name of the 1996 television film to Doctor Who (1996) (in my personal opinion, an infinitely better name), why not try to resolve the seemingly never ending debate of whether it is 100,000 BC or An Unearthly Child? Talk:100,000 BC (Doctor Who)
 19:02, 9th January 2006 (GMT)

Okay can we also try to bring peace to the Middle East and Northern Ireland, bring harmony between all religions, sort out whether the UK is an international or European country and all those other things that have been fiercely argued a lot? ;-)  

I hate to say it, but I think the debate is about to get a second wind, seeing as the upcoming American DVD release, The Beginning dubs the story An Unearthly Child and also uses the Edge of Destruction name for the Inside the Spaceship two-parter...  

I think you're right, and that we should think about people less familiar with the original series; after all, a lot of people who have only watches the Ninth and Tenth Doctors in action will snap up the boxset, to learn more about Doctor Who. Calling it An Unearthly Child will not only help these """"newbies"""", but also seeth the feelings of quite a lot of Whovians I know. (As well as this, at least half of the sources I have seen - official or otherwise - call it """"An Unearthly Child"""").  20:39, 9 January 2006

The current opener to the article and the redirects handle the requirements anyway. Fandom has long been deeply divided and I don't think some notion of appeasing one wing of the debate should direct where the Wikipedia page is located.   
 I agree. As long as the proper redirects are in place and the article acknowledges the alternate titles, I think we're good. This isn't quite the same situation we had with the TV movie when an off-the-cuff remark by the producer calling it Enemy Within came to be seen as somehow official. (And the Doctor Who Information Network here in Canada apparently uses a different title altogether that was mentioned in a CBC profile of the series made to tie in with the Eccleston season. I forget the name that was used.).  

The CBC profile I think used """"Out of the Ashes"""", which apparently came from a misreading of Shannon Patrick Sullivan's webpage.  As for 100,000 BC vs. An Unearthly Child, I agree that the redirects and article opening make the issue less pressing, but I also think that the title used in the DVD release (which isn't just in the US, but UK as well) lends a bit more weight to the An Unearthly Child argument.  However, if we do reconsider the page's location, I agree that it shouldn't be about appeasing one group or another, but what's best for the article.  — (talk • contribs) 

The DVD releases seal it for me - these should both be at their DVD titles, with the others being redirects.  

That's a good point to raise. I personally believe that it should be An Unearthly Child; but then it's not up to me, and I fully understand where Josiah is coming from. Why don't we settle this once and for all: a democratic vote where Whovians like ourselves vote for one title or the other. Anyone else agree/have another idea?   16:18, 11 January 2006

I'll put my vote in as An Unearthly Child also.  

It's been said before, but I'll say it again. The title of the serial is 100,000 BC. The title of the first episode is """"An Unearthly Child"""". The fact that BBC Enterprises releases the DVD as """"An Unearthly Child"""" is a matter of marketing, not historicity, and neither here nor there. The real reason the serial was called An Unearthly Child to begin with was because of a mistake by the Radio Times. AUC redirects to the right page, and there's no confusion. I'd rather rename The Daleks to The Mutants rather than change 100,000 BC to that.  (talk • contribs) 16:39, 11 January 2006"

0,"Clearly you *haven't* read WP:NPA, otherwise you wouldn't have written this. It is difficult to understand why someone interested in Jeremy Sinden should instead rush across to his far less well-known brother's article and immediately feel the need to remove tags? The tags remain because the article is in severe need of a rewrite, not least because one of the main contributors has claimed to be a 'good friend' and a 'fan' of Marc Sinden from the age of 12(!), when they met on the set of the 'Hey Jude' video recording(!). Unfortunately this is the very same editor that was caught dragging along a bucket-load of socks to try and support various POV positions and outright puffery of Marc Sinden and Sinden-related articles. Amazingly enough, this editor and their socks have added Marc Sinden's name to around 130 articles on Wikipedia. 130! For someone who's less notable than my goldfish!
It's certainly true that the Jeremy Sinden article might lead one here, because of course there are no less than *three* mentions/links to Marcus' page from there - sadly there is not one single link from Marcus' back to Jeremy's, indeed his name has been expunged completely from the Marc Sinden article. It seems more than odd that you should seem so determined to enter an edit war in only your first day as an editor, instead of fixing the egregious error that would strike any true contemporary of Jeremy's immediately! May I therefore suggest you take three actions? 
1. Go read WP:NPA yet again, just in case it hasn't impinged. 
2. Add links and content to the Marc Sinden article that reflect and respect the memory of your school chum Jeremy Sinden, because in all the puffery of Marc, poor Jeremy seems to have been wholly ignored. 
3. Expand the content of the Jeremy Sinden article such that it *at least* matches the Marc Sinden article, because it is a disgrace that the puffed-up Marc Sinden article is perhaps ten times the size of the Jeremy Sinden article, when Jeremy was perhaps ten times more notable - go and put this right. 
Finally, as an observation; as a contemporary of Jeremy you would be around 60 years old - it is both surprising and disappointing that with such advanced age has not come the sense of insouciance, and the wisdom of seniors, that one might normally expect. May I suggest that you therefore refrain from further conflict and personal attacks, and put your editing efforts to work exclusively on the person you *do* know about? Thanks."
0,"Editing 

OK, I just edited the introduction for clarity and grammar. I also added two references, one to a Chinese-English dictionary (in print) removing the Google citations (Google is less authoritative than a dictionary published by Harvard University Press), and another to a dictionary of sexology that I helped edit that points to complexities in how the word girl is defined and used in English.

I also included the 7-18 year-old criterion for defining the Japanese word, as I just mentioned in the preceding comment.

Reference #6 is to a Chinese language website, which is not helpful to readers of an English-language Wikipedia. The quote from the Book of Han is overstated (undue weight) and needs to be translated. If not, then we should remove it as unnecessary baggage that tells an Anglophone reader nothing at all.

If that's all OK, can we move to the table?"

I cited the inscriptional record which is the basis of Caragounis research and the dishonest advocates of the reconstructed pronunciation erased that too.

 Detailed chronology - 2 

Now that the legalities are covered...

This is massive material. It tends to overwhelm the article, which is now bloated to three times the recommended size of a Wikipedia article. I think we need to summarize here and factor out to separate articles, maybe one for each year.
While clearly well researched, the material is quite POV in the selection of what it covers. I'm firmly on the side of the Republic  one of the first things I ever learned to say in Spanish was """"Sueño y una ametralladero y Franco se va paseo,  but this Wikipedia articles are not the place for partisan polemic. A chronology this detailed should also include the anti-Catholic atrocities by anarchists and other supporters of the Republic. This doesn't.
The material is written in indifferent English. Right now, I'm engaged in a copy edit, which is being made difficult by the size of this article and the current miserable state of the servers.
I do not think it is appropriate in Wikipedia to repeatedly refer to the Nationalists as """"the Fascists"""".  Would I call them that in my own writing outside Wikipedia? Sure. And someone on the Right would probably use different words than """"Republicans"""", """"legitimate government"""", etc. in his/her own writing. Here, I'd favor """"Nationalists"""" or """"Insurgents"""" almost everywhere that the article currently says """"Fascists"""". Does anyone want to present an argument to the contrary?
Anyway, I'm trying to clean this all up. Suggestions are welcome. So is help. I'm not sure how much time I'll have for this  it's not my main focus within Wikipedia, and I suspect that (for entirely good reasons) I may soon have a lot less time for Wikipedia than I've lately had.   | Talk 23:25, Jan 19, 2005 (UTC)"""

 I see that you found the report on WP:ANI.  The solicitation of warned/blocked users to use their IPs to revert my edits is almost amusing, if it weren't disruptive to others.  However, I'm certainly not going to let a troll/group of trolls keep me from contributing to the encyclopedic content of Wikipedia, nor deter me from reverting vandalism and blocking vandals.  Just a bump in the road.  Thanks for your diligence and for answering TonyTheTiger.  That info was helpful — and I won't make the effort to add this group of edits to a checkuser request.

Russell was active in the Fabian socialist movement.  His political thought was certainly very sympathetic to many technocratic ideas, but was generally more abstract than any ideology.  Roads to Freedom makes patent his political promiscuity: Russell was willing to support any movement that would tend to push history towards human freedom, humane social relations, and the rational satisfaction of human needs.  (Although when nuclear war was concerned, he seemed to prefer social injustice to complete ruin).  On the other hand, Russell was deeply skeptical of technology and science in its influence on human society and culture.  The Scientific Outlook was his vision of a scientific dystopia—one which incorporates much of technocracy.  (For the uninitiated: it is somewhat similar to Brave New World).  Although the technocratic elements are not necessarily portrayed in a negative light, they are not left blameless for the resulting society.  All in all, it seems hard to imagine that book could be the work of an enthusiastic technocrat. — 06:39, 27 January 2007"

No one yet has any clue as to what genes work to produce hair form and yet we here such facts, probably from the view point of some American or Western person who's most familiar dark skinned group are people with mostly recent West AFrican ancestry. And admixture with whom, themselves? As i've said we barely have an itch on the genes in the field (we may be getting closer) and i have friends who have no recent relatives with less curly or coily hair, all black skinned black people and the oldest son has almost curly hair, while the daughters don't. Also, the straight hair i see in the tropics is like that of most mammals that live in the heat, sort of rough looking, and not smooth and oily like that of Northern Eurasians, or like Penguin feathers or whatever it is on walrusses. The fact is that there are Mountains up and down East Africa (where we originate), in Northern Africa, and in West Africa, whose populations are usually less heavily pigmented than other groups (Ethiopia is familiar) possibly because of the angle of the UV rays (like elsewhere). It's unscientific to speak definitively on an issue all based on subjective posterings, ie, admixture. Further, the article isn't about admixture but what selective factors may be at play here. Unless you're aim is to tell people whose ancestors may have had nappy hair that they formerly had such, which would not be very possible at the moment let alone smooth. Again, who says the whole range has to originate from admixture instead of slow evolution of diversity (which decreases on its way to Eurasia, so you'd have to hypothesize on they instantly loose diversity in comparison with others, including Native American groups who weren't even there long enough to become depigmented."

And the dingo is a domestic dog? Here is again the whole not researching topic. You say it is not a domestic dog because it's classified as a different subspecies? What is that classification based on? And in fact, that seems not to be the name with the widest use, that's probably still canis familiaris dingo. And some even use the name canis lupus familiaris dingo or Canis lupus forma familiaris dingo, google them if you think you can get yourself to do that. Check the books of Helmut Hemmer if you don't believe that the dingo shows the same features which are regarded as being caused by domestication and which are also present in other domestic dogs. And the degeneration statement was made source 1-10 (except 7). I'm done with you, and by the way, once you eradicate the sentence, I will readd them, over and over again, as often as necesarry and that's a promise."

It says to use secondary sources primarily, not exclusively.

Besides it being a rather obvious, observable fact that the new street lights are brighter, we have a reference in that they were claimed to be 'safer' (i.e., provide more light). 

The fact that light pollution is increased with increased brightness is non-arguable, it'd be like saying you have to prove the sun is generally brighter at mid-day. Light pollution has to do with the amount of light used. Newer street light technology produces more light with less energy. The less energy part is great, it's the more light that has to do with light pollution.

How's this: In 2011, the City announced plans to upgrade 80% of its street lighting to new energy-efficient street lights which use induction technology, a modified form of fluorescent lamp that produces a broader spectrum than sodium-vapor lamps. The new system is predicted to save $2.2 million per year in energy and maintenance costs [37], and was proposed to """"make our neighborhoods safer"""" [37] by producing more light, something that also increases [light pollution], while lowering [visual comfort probability]. Wikipedia. Retrieved February 7, 2014.

In 2014, San Diego announced plans to become the first U.S. city to install cyber-controlled street lighting, using an """"intelligent"""" lighting system to control 3,000 LED street lights.[38]

..(Side Note) I found several non-local references while searching for 'street lights controversy', one claimed a battle was 'raging' in communities across the nation, in places that were making the switch to brighter street lighting. It seems to mostly involve people calling and complaining - Complaints in San Diego held back further instillations along Harbor Drive, and the PR person I talked to said he had dealt with tons of complaints; And that was at an early stage of the upgrade. There's also a battle in Sacramento being waged to keep incandescent bulbs from being completely phased out (I wouldn't be surprised if it's not widely covered by the media), because they haven't come up with a non-toxic energy saving bulb (There actually was one being developed, and now I can't find any information about it). I know it to be controversial for many locals, but I can't provide online references, so I'm sticking to basic facts. (End Side Note)

White House circumcision petition needs signers up to and on OCT 23 https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/petition/ban-non-therapeutic-routine-infant-circumcision/2tqgSZtG Routine infant circumcision is in direct violation of human rights. It is also against the Hippocratic Oath; which states: """"Do no harm."""" Circumcision is harmful to infants and the men that they will become. A circumcision itself takes 1/3 to 1/2 of the male shaft skin on the penis. It also takes over 2000 fine touch nerve sensors, the gentle gliding mechanism that is offered by the foreskin, and the protection of the foreskin itself. It causes unnecessary pain to the infant and the anesthesia does not block all the pain that an infant feels. In 1993, a ban was formed against genital cutting of infant females. Under the law the ban should also cover male infants too as the equal protection act states. It's time for all sexes to be protected from this barbaric practice.

I lost count above 1000 

 I was waiting on your comments. 

Feel free to publish at any time. I will move what is in the incomplete list to the novels stubs. I am glad you like the format. I will continue to add more, but that will do for now. I will put the new list up today so it does what the page says. Sorry for the delay, I was waiting on your comment. Eagle talk

 Novels and Movies 

For articles that cover both a novel and a movie of the same title, is there a standard article title format to split them up (e.g. """"Starship Trropers (novel)"""", """"Starship Troopers (movie)"""")? Also, is there a standard novel infobox to be used at this time?

Second things first. Non specifically, but we use {t1|Infobox Book}}. On the naming the major work of the two would tend to get the """"basic title"""" and the other would tend to get either """"Title (novel)"""" or """"Title (film)"""" or if more than one """"Title (Jo Soap novel)"""" or """"Title (1992 film)"""". Hope that helps. Don't forget Disambiguation pages. :   (Talk Page)/ 

And thanks for the heads up regarding archives. Seems a much better way to clean up.  

no problem. :   (Talk Page)/ 

 Criteria 

Criteria is as you set it. I will move the book to novel stuff to the right place. within 26 hours of this post I will put up the new prototype list. Status of the code is go ). 
Note on the criteria, for the current lists it is as stated. For the new proto list (up in 26 hours of this post) it will be very simple, are the hits correct, am I giving you guys articles that have complete infoboxes? I can guarrentee that all the articles will have an infobox... becuase I will be parsing the template category. The primary problem will be to seperate out novels from the books. (right now the code will give both) Remember this is a wiki... All I am doing is writing the code, this wikiproject needs to tell me what to do. (p.s. I want to start to have conversations on one of our forums (WP:NOVEL talk page), rather than on our talk pages. Eagle talk 
To make it 100% clear, the new proto list will have ALL the incomplete infoboxes. Our problem will be sorting the novels from the books. (of course we could do both..., or make this list a joint project...) Eagle talk 

ok by 04:00, 7 july 2006 (UTC) I will be ready. Feel free to edit my statement in the newsletter ) I have other things on my hand. Thanks Eagle talk

 Project news
 The project's automatically generated worklist Novels without Infobox has been worked through giving infoboxes to most of the s. This is about to get a regeneration probably with new genres.
 In addition to the raft of articles on the Simon Templar as The Saint novels added last month, then the Modesty Blaise series and now starting on Matt Helm series. All the inital work of one editor!
 One editor has been putting in sterling work coverting novel articles from """"yyyy books"""" categorization over to """"yyyy novels"""".  
 Again notice that the  now has a new field for """"illustrator"""" for indic"

T-Man, I hate to revert you, especially given that we are apparently going to arbitration and all, but your addition is contrary to the consensus that tooks many weeks to build on this area, and which you left alone until now.  You still seem to be trying to prove that Batman is not gay... we all know this.  Here is your addition:
 However, quotes from the creators of the characters would be missing yet, and Batman had previous romantic interests prior to this point 
Firstly, the comment is not too encyclopedic.  Secondly, no one said that there are quotes from the creators; what was said was that """"it has been suggested that"""" the creators did this in response to the Wertham allegations. This is logical to conclude.  As well, your web citation is not very useful in addressing this issue, although it does seem useful to show the dates the various characters were first introduced, and can be put into Batgirl and other sites (in fact, is already there).
I am going to be very civil with you from now on.  But that doesn't mean I don't have great concerns about these edits, particularly when they address the same issue month anfter month with no flexibility.  """

Finally, a rational argument.  You would think that after 23 archived discussions, a consensus would be reached between both sides...  And after being repeatedly protected, a lead was created to satisfy both sides.  This lead states that Kosovo is a disputed region - because it is.  """"Its majority is governed by the partially-recognised Republic of Kosovo, which has de facto control over the territory; the exceptions are some Serb enclaves. Serbia does not recognise the secession of Kosovo and considers it a United Nations-governed entity within its sovereign territory, the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija.""""  The fact that the majority is governed by the Republic of Kosovo is already mentioned - and bolded.  The fact that Serbia and not all countries of the United Nations General Assembly do not agree with independence is also made evident.  This describes where Kosovo stands, in a few sentences.  Never let your personal opinions distort certain facts, as a bias will be evident.  This includes throwing away the fact that Kosovo is actually a disputed region, and calling it a country in the initial sentence.   """

Notability of Aislin Band
A tag has been placed on Aislin Band requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

[edit] July 2007
 Welcome to Wikipedia! I am glad to see you are interested in discussing a topic. However, as a general rule, talk pages such as Talk:Tort reform in the United States are for discussion related to improving the article, not general discussion about the topic. Please refrain from doing this in the future. Take a look at the welcome page to learn more about contributing to this encyclopedia. Thank you. THF 

 Please stop. If you continue to use talk pages such as Tort reform in the United States for inappropriate discussion, as described here, you may be blocked. THF 

 Please do not attack other editors, which you did here: Talk:Tort reform in the United States. If you continue, you will be blocked from editing Wikipedia. THF 

Retrieved from """"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:RUReady2Testify""""

 I dispute both the method and the substance of THF/Ted Frank's assertions. He asserts that my post on the tort reform article is not related to the tort reform article. It clearly is, and no argument is needed for that, just read it. He asserts that my discussion is """"inappropriate""""a loaded word that usually refers to """"offensive or even actionable language"""" none of which appear in my post, but he does not explain what is """"inappropriate"""" about my post, he unilatery deletes it, despite knowing that the neutrality of the article is disputed and despite the obvious relation of my post to the issue of neutrality and how it can be achieved in this particular article on tort reform. 

THF Ted Frank accuses me of """"attacking"""" other editors and declares that I will be blocked. Inasmuch as I have never attacked any other editors, this assertion is not true, and is itself an attack and a threat. I am asking for a discussion on a flagged subject on this articleneutrality and how it can be achieved. To thwart that discussion is to subvert neutrality.

0,""":The source he is referring to is likely this: the article I discovered.  The reason I invited the wider view (mentioning that other political parties are involved in violence) is because it gives the reader a greater understanding of the elements at play.  Just as if one were to read about sea stars and there is a mention that they eat phytoplankton, mentioning that jellyfish also eat phytoplankton might be useful for greater understanding of the sea stars (are they in the same waters, do they compete for food).  To present this information as if CPI(M) members are singular in their violence is not a correct viewpoint if violence is ongoing between many parties.  In another example, if we were to present a fistfight between a man in a red shirt and a man in a white shirt, when they both were arrested for fighting... If we reported that as """"The man in the red shirt was striking the man in the white shirt repeatedly until eventually he was arrested."""" is not neutral because it gives undue weight to only one portion of a greater conflict, not informing the reader of all the information they could otherwise have.

As to your other question.

If Harmath is truly only supported by a single source, mentioning them unequivocally as a militant arm of the party based on that one source might be undue weight.  Saying """"One source claimed that an organization called Harmath is a militant arm..."""" might be better, but we must take care not to use that as a gateway to simply reprint the article here.  If there is but one source, the weight that this should be given is likely minimal.  Does that properly speak to my viewpoints?  72.192.46.9

Also hat Gott die Welt geliebt, BWV 68? or BWV 68? or Also hat Gott die Welt geliebt?...etc.  I only ask, because I think """"cantana"""" is used a bit too often in the prose.  For example """"He later inserted most of them in his third annual cantata cycle, but kept this one and..."""" Rather than say """"this one"""", I think we need to be a bit more descriptive bearing in mind we speak of other cantatas before this mention.  It would be wrong of us to use the full title, I just wondered if there was a shortened term we could use. Talk """
0,"Basically, Community de-Adminship - the community being allowed to put forward the de-sysoping (removal of system operator status) of an admin - in a kind of reverse of the way the admin was accepted (ie by community votes). The admin status and tools are removed. It's much needed symmetry that will automatically make all areas of Wikipedia more accountable in my opinion. Admins will no longer have emeritus status. It had the most support here, so people created Wikipedia_talk:Community_de-adminship/Draft_RfC. Previously, to remove a 'bad apple' a complaint had to be made at WP:RFC to get arbcoms attention. The CDA proposal is likely to be put through RFC to get attention too. It's more about removing bad apples though - it is something that will make admin think twice about the arrogant way they act. People will think twice about whether they want to be one. Bureaucrats will think twice about the judiciousness of their final decision to check for fairness/consensus (if it goes that way, and I think it it may have to). These are all good things - don't trust any administrator who says they aren't! A mop is tool of work - admins must be into the work, not the power. When people are accountable, they behave so much better, and the pipsqueaks are less attracted to the job."

 Wikinews Australia Day 

I notice you haven't been at Wikinews for a couple of weeks.  However there is an article stuck at the starting blocks for a couple of days that might benefit from another Australian taking a look, so I hope you don't mind my posting here at Wikipedia:

 Australia celebrates Australia Day 2009

(It reports on the cricket in Adelaide, if that interests you.)

  

It is now published.  Good luck for the ODI in Perth!   
Yeah, I pinged someone on IRC to review it, because I wasn't sure of the current standards. Regards,   

 Archived clarification 

 Perhaps I am missing something and you have been requested to archive this; however, as we are still in the middle of voting on motions here, could you please reinstate this?  Thanks.    
Once a motion reaches the majority (or in this case, the majority plus a couple), and has been that way for 24 hours, it is considered passed. Is there any special circumstance which allows you to request the passing of this motion to be delayed?   
The motions passed at 01:51 on today's date, which is less than 24 hours. As well, additional clarifications were made in the last 24 hours. I wouldn't call them """"special"""" circumstances, I expect them to remain on the page for at least the 24 hours after the motion passes so that the involved parties can read them.    
Oh, so you'd like me to restore them for three hours then, despite the fact that they are going to read them when I deliver the talk page notifications anyways? Go right ahead. Done. Please also note that in future, given this little piece of silliness by the Committee, everything is going to be archived right on time, and if any member of the Committee objects they need to show me a majority of the Committee supporting their viewpoint before they can do anything about it. It's this kind of ridiculousness—I'm going out in two hours and hence, given the votes over and beyond the majority, it has never been a problem to archive something 3 hours early with such strong support for the motions—that pisses me off about the Committee. We follow the Arbitration Committee procedures, and hence your observation that we need to be """"requested to archive this"""" in your initial comment is a patently incorrect line of thinking.
Ridiculous...   
To be more precise, the first motion passed with Newyorkbrad's abstention at 02:22 UTC, and there were two clarifying comments made to that motion following his vote, in part to address his concerns. You're certainly encouraged to have a life outside of Wikipedia; it's one of the reasons why we have a group of clerks instead of just one. If it's not convenient for you to take an action, I am sure that another member of the team will be happy to do so.    

Hi Daniel, sorry to toss another piece of bureaucracy at you, but since technically this was a clarification of the Martinphi-ScienceApologist case, shouldn't it be posted on that case's talkpage? onka 
No, because it served to amend the SlimVirgin case. I will post a link at the talk page of the Martinphi-ScienceApologist case to where the motions are archived, but given the Martinphi-SA case wasn't the one being clarified or altered, it's correct residence is the SlimVirgin talk page.

 about your comment on Elaragirl's talk page 

Hello Dev920, I couldn't help but notice your comments on  talk page under the heading """"Esperanza"""", so I'm sorry if you feel this was an intrusion of your privacy (or Elaragirl's). I wanted to remind you that there is a spectrum of individual editors who claim affiliation with Esperanza, and some editors, how shall I say this? contribute less towards the mainspace than others.  As for the governance issue, I personally don't understand the current structure and I don't feel as if they exert any influence on me at any rate.

I still think that an off-Wikipedia coffee lounge that has an obvious link on Esperanza's page is the best way to satisfy those users who like to spend their time in the lounge, and still address the concerns of those who are opposed to its presence on Wikipedia. What's one more click of the mouse? Just so you know, I had participated a little in the coffee lounge, but I got turned off of it because of the random dog barking and a series of dirty jokes which I felt were sexist, offensive, and not at all belonging on Wikipedia. Because I had participated only to a limited extent, my overall edit count (2971 as of ) wasn't seriously affected when the coffee lounge was deleted.

I had proposed a hypothetical merger between Esperanza, the Kindness Campaign, and Concordia, and while I still think that many of their stated goals overlap, I also feel that Esperanza needs to better define itself before even considering such a merger, and feedback must be solicited from members of all three groups. I was unaware that Esperanza had a prior history of attempting mergers in the past. If you feel that my suggestion was naive and arrogant, chalk it up to my own shortsightedness, not to Esperanza as a whole.

I know that we may differ in our views of what to do with Esperanza, but at least the MfD and in particular comments by you, Elaragirl, and others, have given the impetus for Esperanza to examine itself. Thank you for that.

Since I've typed this much, I might as well invite you to review me at editor review. Thanks again for your participation in all of this.  """

Wrong again.  So far you have only based your claim on a web site.  Iranica does NOT say that Aryanem Vaejo is in Afghanistan, nor does Iranica say that any part of Afghanistan has ever been called Ariana.  If it does, paste the EXACT quote here WITH A LINK to that article.  The association of Afghanistan and """"Ariana"""" for the FIRST TIME IN HISTORY appeared after World War II and this includes the name for their airlines """"Ariana Airlines"""".  You seem to be of the mindset that no matter what, nobody should change what you put in the articles. This is indicative of poor upbringing by your parents. Your parents have produced a foolish Mr. Know It All who is not smart enough to distinguish between the real world and the our-son-is-never-wrong environment of his mommy's house.  This is stupid.  I have offered plenty of serious and verifiable examples that shows what you are forcefully injecting in this article is wrong,  but it seems that you are only interested in a stupid and stubborn childish game of just winning an argument at any cost, no matter what the truth is. Tell me which of the following points is wrong:
1- No reputable scholar has ever claimed that Aryanem Vajo is in Afghanistan.  

2- One scholar, the late Professor Bahram Farahvashi, who dedicated his life to Iranian studies and has several respectable publications, including his award winning Dictionary of Pahlavi Language, has a book by the title of """"Iran Vij"""" which is precisely about Aryanem Vaejo which Zereshk claims to be Afghanistan. According to this book, as well as other scholars, Aryanem Vaejo is next to the Caspian Sea.  Farahvashi also mentions the names of the scholars who think (and gives their reasons as to why they think) that Aryanem Vaejo is next to the Aral Sea.  In no case anybody has suggested it is in Afghanistan.

3- In at least three of the Achaemenids inscriptions (by Darius I and his son Xerxes) where they mention the word Arya  (that is, the Old Persian word Arya) in the SAME INSCRIPTION they also mention Haraiva (modern day Herat which was recorded as """"Aria"""" in Greek texts) as one of the provices under their rule.  The two words are DISTINCLY DIFFERENT words with different spellings.  Only due to the Greek rendering of Haraiva as Aria this confusion exists today (and even then, it surfaces after World War II, because someone found a way to associate Afghanistan with """"Aryan"""" and others picked it up.)

4- Unlike what Zereshk claims, Encyclopedia Iranica DOES NOT say that Afghanistan is the same as Aryanem Vaejo nor does it anywhere say that Afghanistan has EVER been called """"Ariana"""".

5- Show me one authentic source from BEFORE WORLD WAR II, that shows any part of Afghanistan has ever been called """"Ariana"""" or """"Aryana"""".  Just one source would be enough, but it has to be an authentic and academically acceptable source, such a book from antiquity or the like, and NOT afghani web sites from the 21st century.  By repeating that the """"official afghanis website says so"""" you only show how weak your argument is.

5- Last but not least, in your revert message you offered the reason [this is] """"the OFFICIAL POSITION of The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan""""  well, that is not good enough.  Wikipedia is an encyclopedia not the official website of Afghanistan.  What """"the OFFICIAL POSITION of The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"""" is irrelevant here.  We are interested in correct information.  """

0,"""==Celtic Language?==

It says in the article that after St. Patrick was captured he began to learn """"the Celtic language.""""  It is commonly agreed among Irish historians that the Irish are not actually Celtic (e.g. the Irish learned the Celtic style of art from communication with the European mainland, etc.).  So did they speak the Celt language? I defer to an expert on this one. 

To be more precise, what the article means is that he learned """"a Goidelic language"""" or """"the Old Irish language"""". Patrick would have already spoken a Brythonic language and some Latin. Depending on exactly where he came from in Britain, he might have known a Goidelic language as well. Celtic languages and Insular Celtic languages explain how Goidelic and Brythonic may have been related to each other and to other Celtic languages.   (Talk) 

Are you kidding?  Please identify your source in claiming that """"is commonly agreed among Irish historians that the Irish are not actually Celtic.""""  Recent research has revealed that the Celts did not displace pre-celtic peoples but Celts did come to Ireland and the predominant culture remained celtic until English colonization.  Second, Gaeilge is a celtic language of the Q-celtic branch of the Celtic language family, thus the Irish of Patrick's day spoke a celtic language and it is assumed that Patrick learned said language.  Ergo, he learned a celtic language (though, as noted above, he probably already spoke a P-celtic brythonic language prior to his enslavement.

I have seen broken dates for specific invasions of the British Isles from mainland europe during the collapse of the Roman empire, these not only include Picts, Scots, Irish, Angles and Saxons and more bizzarely English! I will have to dig the book out with dates.  

St. Patrick: Fact and Fiction

I have removed 'was captured by Niall Noigiallach' as it is an obvious error. I will try to come back some time in the future and help with citation and new material.

What are the sources for the following statments?

1 - """"born Patricius Magonus Sucatus""""
2 - """" seems to have studied at the monastery of Lérins on the Côte d'Azur from 412 to 415 ...He spent the next 15 years at Auxerre were he became a disciple of Saint Germanus of Auxerre and was ordained possibly about 417.""""
3 - """"Saint Germanus consecrated Patrick bishop about 431, and sent him to Ireland to succeed Saint Palladius, the first bishop, who had died earlier that year. """"
4 - """"There was some contact with the pope. Patrick visited Rome in 442 and 444. """"
5 - """"Popular devotion to Patrick began in France, long before Sucat received the noble title of Patricius""""

These and other statments seriously mar what is otherwise a fairly good and reasonably well written article. Also the chronology implicit in them is all over the place. The fact of the matter is that no one know for sure what the dates of Patrick's life are; those of 461 (arriving in Ireland) and 491 (death) are estimates arrived at only after decades of discussion. Will whoever rewrote this article please show the basis for including these statments. Thank you. 

I've re-revised the article again in line with what I wrote above, for the simple reason that Pcassidy reverted back to his version again without citing sources for statments I take issue with. I dislike doing this unilaterally because it is against the spirit of wikipedia, but it seems I have to draw attention to this in some manner other than being polite. , 18:52 pm, 18th April 2005.

But there is no cherry picking. The article contains the most reliable information. There are many studies presented by religiously affiliated/motivated institutions and scientists. That's not reliable. There are studies presented by outright bigots. That's not reliable. There are studies that claim to show one thing, but do not. That's not reliable. The organizations in the article, which have membership in the hundreds of thousands of scientists and researchers around the world, are not unreliable nor do they present subjectively biased conclusions based on what they studied. Pointing out a difference, for example, of a male child of two lesbians not being as aggressive as the male child of a man and woman is very trivial. The conclusions that the scientific world has come to is that, while there may be some isolated differences, which exist in all types of families not just those with same-sex parents, it is inconceivable to make the generalization that one is better or more efficient than the other. The only contrasts which my have significant differences are those families who do not have two parents, no matter their gender. So there is no rational basis, in my mind and obviously the mind of most studied science on this, to even try to contradict that. –  (talk · email) """

Larry Sanger has the same diagnosis that i do. I have more to offer
in terms of how to solve the problem. But not whilst being blocked
by trolls and their pet admins for making the effort.

""""Wikipedia has, to its credit, done something about the most serious trolling and other kinds of abuse: there is an Arbitration Committee that provides a process whereby the most disruptive users of Wikipedia can be ejected from the project. 

But there are myriad abuses and problems that never make it to mediation, let alone arbitration. A few of the project's participants can be, not to put a nice word on it, pretty nasty. And this is tolerated. So, for any person who can and wants to work politely with well-meaning, rational, reasonably well-informed peoplewhich is to say, to be sure, most people working on Wikipediathe constant fighting can be so off-putting as to drive them away from the project. This explains why I am gone; it also explains why many others, including some extremely knowledgeable and helpful people, have left the project. 

The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problemor I, at least, regard it as a problemwhich explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist (which would, in this context, mean excluding the unwashed masses), it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts. (Those who were there will, I hope, remember that I tried very hard.) 

I need not recount the history of how this nascent policy eventually withered and died. Ultimately, it became very clear that the most active and influential members of the projectbeginning with Jimmy Wales, who hired me to start a free encyclopedia project and who now manages Wikipedia and Wikimediawere decidedly anti-elitist in the above-described sense. 

Consequently, nearly everyone with much expertise but little patience will avoid editing Wikipedia, because they willat least if they are editing articles on articles that are subject to any sort of controversybe forced to defend their edits on article discussion pages against attacks by nonexperts. This is not perhaps so bad in itself. But if the expert should have the gall to complain to the community about the problem, he or she will be shouted down (at worst) or politely asked to """"work with"""" persons who have proven themselves to be unreasonable (at best). 

This lack of respect for expertise explains the first problem, because if the project participants had greater respect for expertise, they would have long since invited a board of academics and researchers to manage a culled version of Wikipedia (one that, I think, would not directly affect the way the main project is run). But because project participants have such a horror of the traditional deference to expertise, this sort of proposal has never been taken very seriously by most Wikipedians leading the project now. And so much the worse for Wikipedia and its reputation. 

This lack of respect for expertise and authority also explains the second problem, because again if the project participants had greater respect for expertise, there would necessarily be very little patience for those who deliberately disrupt the project. This is perhaps not obvious, so let me explain. To attact and retain the participation of experts, there would have to be little patience for those who do not understand or agree with Wikipedia's mission, or even for those pretentious mediocrities who are not able to work with others constructively and recognize when there are holes in their knowledge (collectively, probably the most disruptive group of all). A less tolerant attitude toward disruption would make the project more polite, welcoming, and indeed open to the vast majority of intelligent, well-meaning people on the Internet. As it is, there are far fewer genuine experts involved in the project (though there are some, of course) than there could and should be. 

It will probably be objected by some that, since I am not 100% committed to the most radical sort of openness, I do not understand why the project that I founded works: it works, I will be told, precisely because it is radically openeven anarchical. 

I know, of course, that Wikipedia works because it is radically open. I recognized that as soon as anyone; indeed, it was part of the original plan. But I firmly disagree with the notion that that Wikipedia-fert"

Oppose. Plainly contrary to practice and a violation of WP:CONSISTENCY. Articles which merely list the """"members"""" of an organization like this, with little or no sourced explanatory text about the organization itself, are identified as """"list"""" articles. See, for example, List of members of the Baseball Hall of Fame, List of National Four-String Banjo Hall of Fame members, List of members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, List of Water Skiing Hall of Fame Inductees, List of Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees, and List of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Individual """"Hall of Fame"""" articles, in contrast, deal with halls which actually exist as institutions (not simply as names given to lifetime achievement awards) and whose articles have substantive content about the hall itself, beyond the list of members and simple chronological entries. The distinction has not been carefully observed, but that is no reason to further muddy the waters rather than clarify them. Here, the is no actual hall as an institution (unlike the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, NY, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, MA, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, OH, the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame & Museum in Knoxville, Iowa, the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, IA, or even the National Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame in Hayward, WI.

Yeah, I think I wrote most of that section some years ago (although I didn't give it the heading """"Summary"""", which makes it sound more definitive than I perhaps meant).

The rest is not incredibly straightforward as a lot of the most recent research is not in widely available reliable sources. I think Bane's stuff is fine as far as it goes, especially his summary of other people's research, but it's not a published book.

Having said that, they came to fairly similar conclusions to later writers, if you ignore the outlying Primitive Archer test.

Apparmor is only configured to protect the printing system by default, I think that if they want to get preachy about security, then the place to start is the 14 or so vital, critical, system daemons that can obliterate the system if a malicious user is able to usurp them, Red Hat, Fedora and security conscious distributions actually protect their users with SELinux, which isn't completely worthless, as AppArmor pretty much is.

Case in point, you write a profile in AppArmor, I come along and symlink the resource you're trying to protect, and BAM, I have just rooted your box...AppArmor is as much protection from being hacked or from a malicious local user, as putting a wet paper bag over your head while a nuclear bomb is going off.

Another thing Noobuntu is infamous for is crippling SU (substitute user), sudo on a server is unwieldy and selling sudo on security is basically snake oil, Ubuntu sets you up with root-like permissions anyway, and doesn't make any attempt to tech you how to limit other users access to the system appropriately.

Just a friendly reminder to use an edit summary when proposing deletion for an article.  Edit summary usage is always good, but it is especially important that edit summaries are used when proposing deletion.  The reason for this is that articles proposed for deletion that later have the  tag removed should not be proposed for deletion again, but rather sent to Wikipedia:Articles for deletion.  The only easy way to check if an article was previously proposed for deletion is to look at the edit history and the edit summaries people have left before.  Thanks!

A Wiki page entitled CrossFire Fusor, that was deleted in October 2010, as a result of this AfD debate:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/CrossFire_Fusor

now appears to have come back to life, in a new page here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrossFire_Fusor

As discussed in the AfD, the above page appears to be pseudoscientific nonsense, strung together by a 42 year old guy named Moacir L. Ferreira, from Curitiba, Brazil, who has a degree in computational science, and clearly a very active sci-fi imagination.

Another apparent bit of pseudoscience by Moacir L. Ferreira implanted on Wikipedia can be found here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_Displacement_Space_Drive

These pages should be nominated for deletion. 

Clearly there is an intent to populate Wikipedia with his self-published pseudoscience.

  
. However, Phase_Displacement_Space_Drive will have to go to WP:AFD.   

 Message to 50.99.244.233 wrt Kunjaliyan 

The article was not deleted. It was moved to the article incubator as a result of this discussion because the film has not yet been released. If I had not done this then the article most likely would have been deleted. The article is at Wikipedia:Article Incubator/Kunjaliyan. You are welcome to work on it there and when the film is released and/or it gets more coverage then it can be moved back into article space.   

 User:Amyabaker/Noddle 
 I received this message. But, as you fully protected page   

Anthony, you were involved at User talk:Amyabaker/Noddle. I think the full protection in this situation is uncontroversial enough that you can unprotect it yourself. I will have to log off soon, and I'd like to post the changes now instead of later.   
   
Thank you! I have updated the draft with my changes.   

I'll trust Anthony's judgement on this matter but normally it's reasonable to protect pages that are temporarily restored for DRV.   
I understand that pages restored for DRV are generally protected. However, because this was a speedy deletion, and because I had addressed the speedy deletion reason with a rewrite, I think it was a good application of unprotection.   

 An AFD you closed was restarted two days later 

You closed Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/World of Books Ltd as No consensus, and Phearson, who said delete in that debate, two days after your close opened a new AFD at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/World of Books Ltd (2nd nomination).  Can you speedy close this and warn him of the rules?

Please tell me does wikipedia allow ADMINS to hold a biased one sided opinion? When SIKH HISTORY admin have openly declared adherence to a strict orthodox viewpoint, you as MOD should really be enforcing wikipedias own rules on your own admin. You unblocking me is secondry to the blatent disregard for wikipedia rules on diet in sikhism. So its NOT MY truth that i hold, its wikikpedia rules that i hold, which YOU disregard. Now you have barred me, because you deem me argument on integrity an attack on ADMIN, when i have repeated over and over again, its an ISSUE of an article which is purely one sided. Now does wikipedia allow blatant disregard of rules from their own ADMIN? 

From the same scholar, same book, same ISBN NUMBER, one rejected and one accepted, the accepted statement fits in with the ADMINS own orthodox stance which he has openly declared on his Wikipedia page. 

1.QUOTE FROM ARTICLE - Gobind Singh Mansukhani states how vegetarianism and meat-eating has been left to the individual Sikh. 2.QUOTE FROM DELETED PASSAGE -scholars hold a view that Sikhism has an ambivalent view on diet, yet some accept that there are, 

“passages against meat eating”. REF for both 1 and 2. Gobind Singh Mansukhani, Introduction to Sikhism, Delhi: Hemkunt Press, ISBN 81-7010-181-6, “There are passages against meat, in the Adi Granth”. Both references from the SAME scholar, yet one is accepted which is favor of an ambivalent view towards diet, while another assessment from the same scholar admitting their are passages against meat eating, is not accepted. Why the Double standards? 

Why does the ADMIN on sikhhistory, blatantly support their own ideological stance, to the point of synthesis, and selectively using texts and passages, from authors who they cite, and then reject the same authors when going against their position? 

How can you adressing harassment, yet make no attempt on addressing the issue of BIAS in your articles? Do you only protect the Orthodox Sunni islamic view? and the unorthodox shia view?...IF that is not the case, then please can you tell me why sikhhistory ADMIN have taken the biased stance of only abiding by an orthodox POV.

I dont think these questions im asking is harassment, but if my objection is avoided time and again, and the same allegations being made towards the same ADMIN for being one sided, you again have AVOIDED the issue at hand, which is a biased article protected by ADMIN to support their own beleifs, i think that is a greater offense than my trying to get some sense from the ADMIN in question. lol."

 Haywards Heath Town Ladies Football Club  

Hi , I am baffled  as to why my submission is not acceptable  , if you search for  HAYWARDS HEATH   you will find an entry for Haywards Heath Town Football Club  so is it just because we are a womens football Club ?   Also if you search for Hassocks you will see a lenghty entry for Hassocks F.C which includes mention of a ladies section 

With us being the 2nd oldest Womens football Club in the whole of Sussex  surely that is """"Notable """"?   however  I can add   that we  received the Sussex County FA  Charter Standard Club award  for 3 seasons running  - 2007/8 ,2008/9 and 2009/10  seasons  the ONLY womens Club in Sussex to have received the award  , surely that is """"Notable"""" [verifyable on the Sussex County FA website already mentioned 

I await your response with fingers crossed

0,"""It's really very difficult to let you down gently, because I find myself accused by you of edit warring which I totally reject. I understand that you might be doing it to pacify Tiamut but it’s unfair to do it at my expense. If I should speak softly then the above wrong image of me might stick in someone’s mind, which is unfair to me. This version that you are reading is a toned down version of the original. If I still hurt you (HG), then I apologize, as my intention is only to clear a wrong image of me in your mind and by extension in the mind of others.

I'm sorry to say, but you're totally off base. I'll take it that you haven't followed the sequence of events and are totally unaware of who edited what. If you would have checked out the exact sequence of events you couldn't have come to such conclusions and made such comments.

Frankly, I am very disappointed in you trying to equate us. While my reputation is unblemished and everyone who has followed me here knows that I'm here to add my knowledge on Jewish subjects for which I have barely scratched the surface, and although I am bold,  I go out of my way to be fair and uphold the neutrality of Wikipedia. Tiamut on the other hand has one agenda, and one agenda only; to push a Palestinian POV. I'm sorry to say, but your trying to put her in a good light rings hollow. Please check out what many other editors have said about her and then tell me if you still think so. Sorry I cannot sit back and watch you trying to equate us. By equating us you are actually smearing my character and exonerating her which is really not fair. It seems to me that she cannot do any bad and I cannot do very much good; that's the impression I get from your comments.

Here are some things you say which I find incorrect or disturbing. The reason I am calm is because I have given up on her, given up on the mediators, and almost given up on Wikipedia. Only people who think that they can win or accomplish something are passionate in what they do. I'll talk straight and pull no punches. I made my comment on your page only to show you that Tiamut is lying, in the belief that maybe you’ll open your eyes. Tiamut hasn't gotten under my skin at all; I know what she is up to and want to stop it; but if you (not you necessarily) will try to stop me instead of her, then I'll bid all of you good bye and let you have what you deserve. I have no softer way of putting it, that I just can't take this crap that Tiamut thought it reasonable to add """"nation"""" to the opening paragraph. No, she knows exactly what she is doing and such comments are what lets her get away with it. While Tiamut has lost her temper many times; I haven't lost my temper even once; disappointed, yes; lost temper, no. You say that you're surprised that Tiamut didn't go to the talk page earlier; I wonder why you're surprised; don't you see that she first tries to get away with whatever she can, then she'll engage in talk with no intention of compromising but to get part of her pushing accepted and put off the rest for another round. You say that I started my conversation with a negative touch by its heading of POV pushing. My purpose is not anymore to set her straight, which I have already given up. My purpose is to point out her POV pushing to all of you. Actually I think that I'm treating her with kid gloves compared to how administrators would have dealt with her, if they only wanted to. Lastly I completely object to your equating us both as edit warring. When one side explains, but the other side says one thing on the talk page and does something else on the article; then the explainer shouldn't be labeled an edit warier simply to be able to play the equation game. Please get it straight; I am an honest editor and she is a POV pusher, and the twain doesn't meet. She needs to be admonished not mediated; you cannot mediate with someone who will only play the game of mediation with no intention of good faith editing.

Her response to you is a game which allows her to do what she wants while she is engages in dilly-dallying and in false placation. Tiamut has learned to play a game with all of you. She pretends to engage in discussion but in reality does what she wants and then has the audacity to reverse the sequence of events to make it look as if she thought she was doing the right thing. Now watch her threaten that she will report me; that's also part of her game, and if she succeeds then Wikipedia doesn’t deserve any better.   

It's time to call a spade a spade; because otherwise Wikipedia will lose its valuable editors and stay with the crap. I’m really fed up with Wikipedia, and ready to bid everyone farewell.

I apologize for cursing you out.  I lost my temper and it was unacceptable.  I'm completely deserved a block  (although i think you had no right to give it to me).  That said, looking at the last few pages of your contributions, nearly all your edit summaries are """"MoSed"""", """"reverted unexplained and unsourced changes,"""" """"tidied,"""" """"copyedit,"""" or similar. I'm sure I was overstating the case because  I was angry, but this does seem to be your main activity in the main space on wikipedia (not that there's anything wrong with that - it's good to have people who copyedit and so forth, but I think my basic claim was more or less true).  And I don't misunderstand the way wikipedia works.  I've been here for four years, and I've never run into anyone demanding sources for utterly uncontroversial statements the way that you are.  If we are obsessive about this kind of thing, wikipedia will never grow, and it is completely counterproductive to revert unsourced statements of what is essentially common knowledge.  And I think my understanding of this is a lot closer to the way wikipedia actually works than yours is, which is based on a completely non-existent perfect world idea of what wikipedia should be.

Well, I did find a notable referencea book by respected Canadian journalist and author Patricia Pearson called A Brief History of Anxiety (Yours & Mine). Pearson already had an article on her in Wikipedia, and the book was listed in it, but there was no article on the book, so I wrote one. Then all I did is put a reference to it under """"See Also"""" on the Psychiatry and Biopsychiatry Controversy pages. Those references were also deleted by someone who did it skulkingly without identifying him/herself, but it was Crusio, and you can read about Crusio here: [[

The alleged grounds for the deletions was that it's an """"obscure anti-psychiatry book"""" although I am 100% sure Crusio has never read it and knows nothing about it, nor did s/he bother to do the least bit of research into it. I am now CONVINCED that there is a conspiracy among certain scientific-establishment Wikipedia editors to protect their buddies with vested biologistic psychiatry interests. Unhappily, those are the guys with all the letters after their names and the trillions of dollars in pharmaceutical company funding behind them, so little can be done about it by an obscure and impoverished nobody like me.

Fine, gentlemen, but as it appears it's only ourselves having this """"discussion"""", allow me to submit this for your inspection, as sent by Turner May 19 to all media, the TPS and its Board (blocked by the latter two) and yes,  Fantino himself, in response to the latest headlines. If you ever change your minds...

Original to Leo Kinahan, counsel for Sgt. Jim Cassells

Mr. Kinahan:

Having discovered how sensitive you are about your e-mail address, note that I have included you as a BCC to protect your privacy. As I have been battling with the media ever since my saga began, I am only including them, at this time, in the hope that - considering the recent brave actions of your client and the resultant headlines which have followed - they may, finally, be forced to recognize my plight and resultant complaint since it all began.

As briefly as I can describe it, I was set up by 55 Division in November of ' 98 with a manufactured charge of Criminal Harassment as a favour to their local coffee hangout in my then-neighbourhood, to obviate potential civil litigation I had against it and the parent chain, Second Cup Ltd..Come trial the following year and representing myself, I went to court with 39 witnesses, several exculpatory documents and more. 

As a result of my actions and an airtight defence, the """"complainant"""" - who had been sexually servicing at least one 55 cop (John Maciek) - and two of my defence witnesses associated with the coffee franchise were paid to, respectively, take and avoid the stand.

When this was articulated by myself, the original two arresting officers, Paul Scudds (immediately afterwards appointed by Fantino to Internal Affairs, itself) and Sheila Richardson, attempted to smash through my door without cause or warrant, causing me to secure counsel, ostensibly for my own protection, in the person of Lorne Honickman.

Where I lose all of the media, in their zeal to protect one of their peers, is the fact that Honickman took a bribe from Second Cup CEO  Michael  Bregman to throw the trial and protect their """"good name"""", which resulted in his: excluding every one of my witnesses; ordering transcripts to be altered by a Ministry of the A.G. court reporter - who then bailed on both her employer and her apartment and went into hiding, along with her sister/fellow A.G. employee, who resided elsewhere; refusing to admit documents and evidence to prove my innocence and more.

After dismissing Honickman - but still having to return to court to continue the trial - I received a phone call, at home, on Friday, January 7, 2000, from 55's John Graham, informing me that I would not make it to College Park alive with the evidence of all that I put before you now.

Thirty-six hours later, just after 10:00 a.m. on January 9, the threat was made good when a dozen cops from the division assembled themselves outside my door - armed with billy clubs, black leather """"beater"""" gloves and cell phones - with the stated intention (taped phone messages retrieved after my too-narrow escape) of killing me.

Since then, I have run the entire gamut of the complaint system, including three cops I was publicly handed to by Fantino at his precious """"Town Hall"""" meetings: Stu Eley, Wayne Cotgreave and Mike Trimble ( stu.eley@torontopolice.on.ca, wayne.cotgreave@torontopolice.on.ca,  mike.trimble@torontopolice.on.ca).

Prior to - and after - this, upon my own initiative, were Bryce Evans (bryce.evans@torontopolice.on.ca), Dave Mcleod (dave.mcleod@torontopolice.on.ca) and Steven Pipe (steven.pipe@torontopolice.on.ca); all of whom have had the displeasure - or more, the sadistic pleasure - of dealing with/blowing me off - and who disappeared behind voice mail forever after, as did the others, plus every one of the usual suspects in Pro Standards ( jane.wilcox@torontopolice.on.ca, john.knaap@torontopolice.on.ca,  rick.gauthier@torontopolice.on.ca)  that I was referred to and others, including Scott Gilbert of 55 Division     (scott.gilbert@torontopolice.on.ca), whom I was forced to cooperate with by the OCCOPS and provided a gruelling, eight hour video taped statement, only to have same outright ignored - and my complaint dismissed - by the latter.

During your client's original investigation, I actually contacted  RCMP Supt. John Neily and asked him to include my situation in the mix, as Fantino was bleating about rooting out """"perjury and corruption"""" (I was subject to both during my trial) and we cooperatively communicated for eighteen months, only to have - come the moment of truth -  Neily regretfully inform me that he'd been ordered to drop my case.

Now, if you'll allow me to quote from the most recent media reports...

 Weeping Frenchman question

This note is to justify a change in a photo caption.
I have added a well-known historic photo to this page, of a Parisian weeping as German troops occupy his city.  Little is known of the origins of this photo, certainly not the identity of the man or why he cries.  It has been widely assumed that he is sorrowful, since he is witnessing foreign troops enter his home, the surrender of his armed forces, and the capitulation of his government.  I had always understood that this was the general sentiment throughout France, and certainly in occupied (non-Vichy) France.
The original caption stated simply that the man weeps.  This was the caption provided by the photo source (www.archives.gov) and the same caption that appears elsewhere in Wikipedia.  The new caption adds """"in joy or sorrow"""".  The addition adds unnecessary ambiguity, and makes a strong implication away from the general consensus on this photo.
I am open to other opinions about this photo, if they can be sourced.  The caption was changed without comment.  I am reverting.  Please discuss if you disagree."""

An aside, before I ask my question, I tried to provide dispute resolution in that incident, but my involvement was based upon my assumption that Drolz was concerned about being blocked, and wanted to assemble evidence should that occur.

Thank you AnthonyBradbury your comments made sense. The issues I raised relate to the ANI thread still remaining open. Both Erpert,  NEEnt, and now you as an administrator have said that the matter is 'closed.' 

Despite me being blocked 5 days ago and despite Erpert closing the thread and stating no further comments, another editor whatamidoing, removed that and continued making false, baseless claims, quoting inaccurate details, that easily be proved. Further, entirely separate matters, to what my block was for, are now being discussed 'after' I was blocked. Without me having an opportunity to present clear contrary evidence based purely on the objective editing history. And have a fair minded neutral and independent administrator to judge both sides. 

These editors knew there was a ANI thread, but did not comment for 2 days until I was blocked. After I was blocked they then and only then, stuck the boot in, without any facts to back up their false claims. They may have waited until I was blocked because these baselss claims would have been proven false immediately, through me providing diffs and objective facts to the contrary. In fact, they only ceased when I asked for a temporary unblock above to respond! They would have kept 'hammering away' with baseless false claims, providing no facts to back them up and all the while, me being unable to provide the facts. 

I have made some very solid edits to numerous articles. I respect Wikipedia. I respect Wikipedia's policies. I accept the reasons for my current block and would appreciate, after such a significant period, ie. 2 full weeks, to start afresh and be provided an assumption of good faith in my editing rather than editors judging me already. I think all editors, after being blocked should be given the benefit of the doubt. Not to have this thrown in their face for ever more. That's not right. 

I know a lot about some topics. Very little about other topics. My reliable sources have good. My editing and additions have been good. Productive in many different articles. I completely reject being 'incompetent' as whatamidoing states, without me being able to respond. Simply because of differing points of view. I understand whatamidoing and Bilby are very experienced editors who have made great contributions to Wikipedia as editors. No-one is disputing that. They obviously gain a great deal of enjoyment from the project too! Does that provide these editors 'unequal' rights over less experienced editors who are also adding value to the project? Where they can make false baseless assumptions? I realise I have had some previous conflict with the same small group of editors in the past. But that says nothing about my edits being productive and of benefit to the project. 

I believe strongly in the principles of assuming good faith amongst editors. I did not think blocks were punitive whereby other editors can 'mock' the person who has been blocked? Nor are blocks an opportunity to make false, entirely baseless assumptions about an editor's competence. Is the ANI thread closed or is it not closed please AnthonyBradbury? I am hesitant to ask this through a formal request unblocking request. So could an administrator tell me if this ANI thread that was abruptly re-opened by whatamidoing, after the block was already applied, and the thread closed?"

A tag has been placed on Rurika Kasuga, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable, that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging.

""""It is clearly designed to denigrate those who have raised objections to the presence of Islam in Danish society.""""

You should, perhaps, check out the articles from the U.S. Dept of State. There is one on human rights in DK and one on religious freedom. This is factual, academic work, and it is far more damning that anything I have written (yet). I will soon be incorporating some of these new findings provided by the U.S. Dept of State and the U.S. Ambassador to DK into this Wikipedia article.

If DK has a policy of religious freedom, yet officially have a program of harassing immigrants, that will not gain any favor in terms of international relations. It is virtually impossible to have an article that is factual and also presents a view that the Danes are victims of Muslim invaders, because the facts do not support this. You have a bias towards a sanitized version where the DPP is just a conservative party, and then you and your co-horts choose to delete their racist statements made in Parliament and just about every fact that makes Denmark look bad. It's unfortunate that the truth and facts make DK look bad, but it is what it is... The U.S. Dept of State reports are far more damning, and if you think that is biased, it is in fact you who are biased. Please keep your opinions between your underground """"conservative"""" groups.

 Some tips for you! 

Hi , I thought I'd drop a few notes on your talk page with some help on writing articles o)

First of all, it may be best for you to do a bit of reading, starting with the Wikipedia manual of style, which will give you a lot of information about how Wikipedia prefers its articles to be written.  It's not as hard to follow as it might look; quite a bit of the information there probably won't be vital for you at first.

Second, I recommend you make a user sandbox - which is just an area you can use to practise in, and to make notes in, and to get things ready in.  If you click this red link: user:/Sandbox, that will let you create that page (it gives you an edit window to start work in).  Anything, anywhere, on the help and information pages which gives you an example, try it out in your sandbox until you're familiar with it.

For your article, the next thing you want to do is start collecting as much information as you can about it.  Google searches (particularly in Books and Scholar) will be your best friend for this!  Once you've found the information, the next most important thing is to start writing up each fact in your own words (very important, this), and make a note at the same time of exactly where that information came from.  Build in the references as you go along; I'm going to copy in, down below this, a whole heap of help on doing references, which was produced by one of our best teachers ().

Here's another place that you'll find incredibly useful - citation templates which you can copy and paste into your sandbox, between  tags; you just fill in the blanks from your sources into the template, and you'll end up with nicely formatted inline citations o)  It all helps.  Remember to add a references section to your sandbox (make a new line, and put ==References== on it, and type {{reflist}} on the next line, so that you can see how your citations look as you do them.  Remember to save your page often! You don't want to lose your work.

Hopefully this will give you a good start and make life easier for you.  (talk …stalk!) 
How references work

 Simple references 

These require two parts;

a)
Chzz is 98 years old. """"The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 

He likes tea.  [http://www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com Tea website] 

b) A section called """"References"""" with the special code """"{{reflist}}"""";
== References ==
{{reflist}}

(an existing article is likely to already have one of these sections)

To see the result of that, please look at user:chzz/demo/simpleref. Edit it, and check the code; perhaps make a test page of your own, such as user:/reftest and try it out.

 Named references 

Chzz was born in 1837. 
""""The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 
 

Chzz lives in Footown.

Note that the second usage has a / (and no closing ref tag). This needs a reference section as above; please see user:chzz/demo/namedref to see the result.

 Citation templates 

You can put anything you like between  and , but using citation templates makes for a neat, consistent look;

Chzz has 37 Olympic medals.  {{Citation
 | last = Smith
 | first = John
 | title = Olympic medal winners of the 20th century
 | publication-date = 2001
 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]
 | page = 125
 | isbn = 0-521-37169-4
}}


Please see user:chzz/demo/citeref to see the result.

For more help and tips on that subject, see user:chzz/help/refs.

I disagree as the the part in question speaks directly to the bio where Sunny Hostin is described as “... a former Assistant US Attorney, as well as a legal expert and TV personality, who is often called upon for her analysis on various provocative issues and high-profile criminal cases in the news.” The information speaks to her abilities, case knowledge, quality of opinion and ethical standards displayed during and after a nationally streamed debate on a preeminent legal question. Thus the information is directly on point (not random) as regards legal analysis and adds considerably to readers' understanding of legal bias and ethical standards.   Given there is no dispute of the accuracy of the information, the insert should stand."

In order to facilitate reference to talk page discussions, I will need to create an archive page for the talk page content that one of the admins previously blanked.  Is there any problem with that?  

You can link to a permanent revision in the history if need be, so long as the page was not actually deleted.  

As far as I know, nothing was permanently deleted, although some discussions have been moved to archive pages.  The other thing I need to exhibit is the blocking message that KillerChihuahua posted.  That one does not appear in any revision of this talk page; it appears on a template that I see on my user page, but I don't think others see that template.  How do I reference or exhibit that original blocking message?  

Just go into the history, and click the appropriate date on a revision.  That will bring you to a page, with a link.  Here is an example, http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Moulton&oldid;=157221709.

As an aside, what will you do if unblocked?  Do you intend to edit articles again?  

How do I link to something that exhibits KillerChihuahua's original blocking message, wherein she gives the reason for blocking?  

It's too soon to decide what I will do if unblocked, as that depends on what transpires during the course of these proceedings.  If the objectives I set forth in my RfC are embraced and endorsed, then it's reasonable to imagine that it would be feasible for people like me to contribute to the crafting of mainspace articles.  If those objectives are repudiated by ArbCom, then there would be no point in editing articles, even if I were provisionally unblocked on technical grounds related to denial of due process. 

I have one other question on how these cases are titled.  Is there any standard convention on titling these cases?  

this is your block log.  Tilting?  

Not tilting, but titling.  Do I entitle the case """"Moulton"""" or """"Moulton v. KillerChihuaha"""" or """"KillerChihuahua"""" since she is the admin whose actions I am contesting.  

No vs.  You are verses anything.  You are requesting a unblock review to ArbCom.  """"Moulton"""" works.

0,"== Some Main Mechanisms for Transitional Justice in Burma ==

By Aung Thiha

What is transitional justice? Before we talk about some main mechanisms for transitional justice for future Burma, we are supposed to know what transitional justice is. It is mainly subject to the human rights abuses in the past. The most important thing is to search for a justice for both victims and perpetrators involved in the past without any bias. Therefore, we are supposed to find appropriate ways to help those who had seriously suffered from human rights abuses in the past. It is also important to handle those who committed the human rights abuses in the past in appropriate ways. We have to find the truth from both victims and perpetrators without taking sides. It is unquestionable that both opposition groups and military generals have hardliners. For instance, U Kyi Maung, who is one of the members of the National League of Democracy (NLD), used to answer the question made by journalists, saying that they were going to establish international military tribunals like the ones in Germany (8th August 1945) and to try military generals who committed the crimes in the past. It was really a threat for the military generals who are afraid of prosecution. As a result, it can lead to internecine circumstances. 

In relation to the transitional justice in Burma, we consider some main mechanisms to create justice in transitional period. First, in advance we have to investigate the details as to the violations of human rights committed by the military regime in the past so as to become aware of when, where and how they happen. The investigation can include individuals or institutions involved in the past human rights abuses. There can be a lot of obstacles or delay in investigating the abuses. We can also get tangible information from the government files, mass graves and testimonies. For instance, we can investigate the abuses by uncovering the mass graves carried out by the Burmese army in the jungle and by identifying the bodies; who they were, how and when they were executed. It will be very helpful for us to do something against the perpetrators during the transitional period. We also have to make sure that we share information collected with the public so that they can help follow the cases. 

Second, regarding to the prosecution we are still undecided whether we are supposed to offer an amnesty to the military generals, or we ought to try them at the international military tribunal like in Germany. Actually, what the military generals fear most is a prosecution. If we prosecute them, the circle of retaliation against each other will not be able to end, but will also delay of transferring political power to the opposition parties or the obstruction of Burma’s political progress. As a consequence, the civilians will be victims again. Furthermore, prosecution against the military generals is irrelevant to the current political situation in Burma. It is not realistic. On the other hand, if we forgive the generals for their abuses and offer an amnesty to them with a view to the development of the country as a whole, it seems to ignore or overlook the people who had suffered from severe human rights abuses in the past. They will not be satisfied with us in power, and we will lack credibility. In some cases, we find it difficult to prosecute the perpetrators because they, at the same time, are both perpetrators and victims (e.g child soldiers who are forcibly recruited by the SPDC). It is not always possible to regard them as criminals. Therefore, both sides are supposed to think about the whole circumstance and try to negotiate the issues for the sake of the whole country and its people rather than focusing on obtaining political power or personal feelings. It is also important to try to reduce grievances being rooted in both sides. Prosecuting the military generals is not a good solution for the group in power in the long term.  

Third, in the transitional period we can also use civil sanction against those who were involved in the human rights abuses in the past. As I already mentioned, by letting people look at the files that include the details of past human rights abuses, they can distinguish the victims and perpetrators. Then, they can prevent anyone who they think were supporters or collaborators in the past human rights abuses from being involved in future political role by means of demonstration. By not allowing the supporters or collaborators involved in the past human rights abuses to be involved in future politics, we also have to show that we respect the dignity of the people and do not overlook or ignore their sufferings from the past. 

Fourth, reparation also creates the justice for those who had suffered from severe human rights abuses in the past. For instance, in Germany the government compens"

And all this nightmare just to write a useful article on Wikipedia!!!!!

Be sure that I have bettter to do with my life and that it will be the first and only article on Wikipedia in my entire life.

The behaviour of you the people who censored my article is really shameful!

0,"There's a lot more explosive in an ERA box than in a typical incoming warhead, and there is a serious fragmentation and blast damage risk to those standing or sitting nearby.  The US doesn't typically let people ride tanks because tanks attract fire, and people fall off and get run over fairly often (a serious hazard in training, and a significant hazard in combat), and the US has plenty of Humvees and M-2 IFVs.  Other countries tended to both want to reduce training injuries and keep people away from the ERA blocks, and restricted tank riding at the same time.  You saw it a bit in Chechenyia with Russian tanks, but they lost a fair number of infantry to the secondary ERA explosions and stopped doing it.
I support putting the article back for that reason..."

Suppose that I, a British gentleman and university graduate (and therefore arguably entitled to the style Esq in the UK), but not a qualified lawyer of any sort, were to visit the US and happen to use the suffix Esq there.  Could I be prosecuted for misrepresentation?  Do the state bars claim sole right to grant this suffix in the US, or are they just the only organisations which currently do?

The concept and game of K.M.F. was first commissioned by Courtney Porcella—resident of the City of Sin, Lynn, MA—in the early twenty first century in the United States of America, more specifically Massachusetts.  Spreading initially as “Kill-Marry-Fuck” between her and her close friends, this game quickly spread throughout the fourth floor of Donahue at Suffolk University, the school she currently attends.  Although this game quickly manifested itself into a game of pastime, it has never reached its full potential as an ice breaker due to the lingering question of its social acceptability.

Prior to the spring of 2010, K.M.F. was referred to as its founding name, “Kill-Marry-Fuck.”  The cause of the name change was brought on by a Senator from Suffolk University’s Student Government Association.  The main reason behind the move for the change was to reflect the professionalism of the student leaders occupying the offices on the fourth floor of Donahue.  Although K.M.F. was never targeted specifically, people got the message from the Senator and changed its name respectively.

Regardless of the name change, K.M.F. never lost it original essence, Donahue’s pastime.  And the name change now allows players to play K.M.F. in all types of atmosphere, ranging from weddings to preschool school.  Less than a year after the publicizing of K.M.F., this game has expanded to Boston’s neighboring cities.

At the time, Ms. Porcella has no disclosed plans to spread K.M.F. statewide or nationally.

Let me state a fact: if you think """"Religious violence in India"""" has nothing to do with anti-Hindu violence, then I will move it to Violence by Hindus in India against other ethinicites. Then we will debate about what should be here, and what should go there. If you are disagreeing with the fact that anti-Hindu violence is real, then you should get your facts correct (and wikipedia here will not help you, unfortunately). Google is full of webpages, until you subscribe to Ad_hominem#Ad_hominem_circumstantial, common around here, then it will be a littler harder to find. Haphar's theory of what is religious violence and what is not is his own theory, and as such he is entitled to have his own opinions (""""POV"""", a wikiaholic would say) - while they stay out of the article. I am personally entitled to my opinion that his theory is laughably ridiculous - Islamic terrorism - enough said. Regarding having found books about religious violence in India, who is saying it is not present in India? I am saying that no such country exists with two different religions coexisting, and no act of violence ever happening. Having found books doesn't make it worthy of having an article about it. For example, """"Xenophobia in eastern Europe"""" is a well studied phenomena, but we don't have an article about it.

What it does attain, though, is a major part in the discussion. Your rejection of anything else is incorrect.

Anyway... every year there is a new crop of trolls and POV pushers, and my energy is better spent elsewhere. I would just say that """"Religious violence"""" does not refer to """"Hindus killing Muslims"""" - it refers to """"Hindu and Muslims killing each other, and the people with local majority winning.

Kosovo is the drug-trading hot-spot, and so is Albania. Half of the population of Albania are still farmers, using tools that were used centuries ago.

Thanks for the input! I will correct the URLs and the terminology tomorrow. I was under the impression Solus Operating System was a Linux distro and not to be confused with what has a page on here called SolusOS - are you that same project? If not, which I think is the case, I can set it up so this page redirects to a new page with the same article (blanking this one) called Solus Operating System, so long as that is available. If you would prefer right now to not have a Wikipedia article I`ll gladly comply with your wish. Some organizations don` t really want to be on Wikipedia for various reasons. Anyway, I am enjoying your OS. If you get around to it could explain to me what makes Solus its own OS rather than a Linux distro? Also, I understood that although you use Budgie, Gnome is behind it.

Do you not think statements such as those made by Camping should get the same treatment? On a final note, 24 hours from now nearly the entire article I edited will be proven nonsense.

 Greetings from the Opera Project again 

Hi, Satyr.  You'll remember that you and your bot did some excellent work for us (on the Wagner sub-project) a few months ago.  How are you fixed at present?  We'd like to dip a bigger toe in the assessment process by automatically giving a """"Start"""" rating to those articles that are tagged with the Opera Project banner and are not already classified as Stub.

Exceptions:  articles which have been promoted to Good Article, Featured Article or Featured List should show those ratings on the banner.  Also, it would be good if any articles which currently show Stub on the banner but have been manually de-stubbed without the banner having been altered could be rated Start.

We'd like the facility to comment when we start doing the assessments.  For the Wagner project, you organised it so that the banner carries a dormant link:  if a comments page is present, there's a link, but if not, not.  The link will nevertheless appear (and work) if a comments page is subsequently added.

I can give some examples of the various possibilities outlined above if that would help, and you might like to review our correspondence about the Wagner project to refresh your memory of what you did then (also to refresh your memory of how useless we were then at specifying what exactly we wanted, maybe!).

MPT
Hi it has come to my attention that it is only the english articles that uses """"MRT"""" instead of """"MPT"""" which is used in the rest of other language wiki articles especially the Macedonian one. Debunking the romanized alphabet argument, it could be seen how even the logo has put """"MPT"""" in a romanized alphabet form therefore should be the one to be followed. It is practice here in wikipedia to use the official naming used by the one being described in the article no matter what their translation to english might be such as Volkswagen which in direct romanized translation is """"Folkswagen"""" but the former prevailed due to it being the one used in the official logo of the company albeit being romanized too. I understand your argument on the main article """"Macedonian Radio Television"""" that is why I kept that because its original name would not make sense in an expanded form here in english wiki. But its acronym should not be meddled upon especially it has a logo to prove it and the main article could provide the knowledge why MPT and what is its translation to english.Lastly the MRT 1 and MRT 2 pages should be really up for a disambiguation as the MRT worldwide may refer to Mass Rapid Transit or an equivalent rail term.

A little history on this article. Before creating this article I first uploaded images and created categories that relate to this article on Wiki commons under this category """"Category:Kura (Japanese saddle)"""" [Kura_(Japanese_saddle)], this was over one year ago. There has been no objections to the title on Wiki commons.  When I originally named this article I did read the article naming guidelines contained in Wikipedia:Article titles, here are a few quotes from the naming guidelines:(it is sometimes necessary to add distinguishing information, often in the form of a description in brackets after the name.), I did this,  (The choice of article titles should put the interests of readers before those of editors, and those of a general audience before those of specialists.) It seems to me that only a """"specialist"""" would understand what type of saddle a """"kura"""" was, so when I named this article I looked at the list of saddle articles which are now in the category """"Saddles by type"""" and here were saddle articles with titles such as English saddle, Western saddle and Australian Stock Saddle. Looking at these other saddle article titles I decided that Kura (Japanese saddle) would be the best title for this article as anyone who looked at the other articles on saddles could easily and instantly identify what type of saddle the article was about, if I had named the article Kura (saddle) it would not be a descriptive as the other saddle articles and someone with no knowledge of the subject would have to actually click on the title to see what a """"Kura"""" was, with the word """"Japanese"""" added a reader could instantly identify what type of saddle a """"Kura"""" was, much like a reader who saw Australian Stock Saddle, Western saddle or English saddle would have a good idea what that article was about.
I have seen """"precision"""" mentioned, I do not understand how having the title as Kura (Japanese saddle) compared to Kura (saddle) goes against any of the guidelines in the section labeled """"Precision and disambiguation"""", WP:PRECISION, if I had named the article """"Kura (the saddle of Japan) I would understand but how does Kura (Japanese saddle) go against any naming guidelines, how different is Kura (Japanese saddle) than Australian Stock Saddle? The only difference is some brackets. Here is a quote """"Precision – Titles usually use names and terms that are precise (see below), but only as precise as necessary to identify the topic of the article unambiguously."""" WP:NAMINGCRITERIA, the title """"Kura (saddle) not """"precise"""" as it does not actually identify what type of saddle this is to the """"general reader"""", I would rather have the article named """"Japanese saddle"""" than """"Kura (saddle) so that anyone will know instantly what type of saddle this article is about if it is necessary to change the articles title, at least the """"general reader"""" would be able to know what the article is about without having to click on the title as they would with Kura (saddle).

The truth is that """"Moldovan"""" doesn't exist. It's about romanian with a different name. The fact is that is identical with romanian. Romanian is a latin language like french, italian, spanish, portuguese. The Soviet propaganda and the russians experts since 1812 tried to make a difference on political reasons.

Why is Abbie Bakan even mentioned in this article?  Based on the worthless rag of hers which is cited as a source in this article, she's nothing but a shill for Lenin and the rest of the commie gang.  In that rag, she not only shows egregious pro-Communist bias, but doesn't even bother to check the facts, much less look at the causes of the Kronstadt rebellion or even cite reliable historical sources on that subject.  She also discredits herself with absurd accusations of a White conspiracy to overthrow the Soviet government and even of the rebellion being motivated by anti-semitic racism among the sailors.  Furthermore, all the claims made in that rag are based on a case of begging the question: that is, since Lenin's Communist regime was good (major premise) and the Kronstadt rebellion harmed said regime (minor premise), suppressing the rebellion was justified.  Last but not least, the mere fact that the aforementioned rag was first published by a self-admitted socialist party by definition means that this source DOES NOT meet EITHER WP:NPOV OR WP:RS.

0,"English English vs American English vs ...

In an earlier edit changing petrol to gas, I wrote in the edit comment that I was changing the wording to American English (gas) because that's the standard for this Wikipedia. Another user pointed out that my assertion of an American English standard for this Wikipedia was incorrect according to the Wikipedia Manual of Style. That user is correct. I was unaware of the Manual of Style's position on this, so I read into it. According to the MoS, there is no standard form of English for the English language Wikipedia. Instead, the language that one uses in a given article depends on: 1) the form of English most closely associated with the topic, and 2) the form of English used by the first major contributor to the article. The article should, in any case, adhere to one standard form of English (for example, American English, British English, Canadian English, Indian English, or Australian English)

I'd like to talk about this for a bit, because I think we may have an interesting boundary case in this article that helps further define the MoS policy on how to select the correct English variant for an article.

English language variants and Unimogs
Item 1 above says that the version of English used in an article should be the one most closely aligned with the subject. The Unimog is a German truck, and so one would have a hard time saying that there is a particular form of English closely aligned with the topic, at least when it's spoken of in Germany. The Unimog has an especially weak association with England, as the British military and farm trades did not (as far as I know) make much use of the Unimog, instead heavily prefering the British designed and built Land Rovers. The Unimog was used in many other nations, however, including Switzerland (by the Swiss military) and some nations in Africa and Asia. I am not aware of the modern history of the Unimog outside of Europe, but I know that in the 60s and 70s, when it was at its peak in terms of exposts, it was purchased in these regions for military applications. In Asia and Africa, I am unaware of any particularly strong association between the Unimog and a given variant of English.

There was one market the Unimog was sold in where there was a strong association with a particular variant of English, and that was the United States. Daimler-Benz, through its dealers and representatives, has sold and services Unimogs in the United States for I believe over twenty years. 

To add to American English argument, in recent years, Daimler-Benz merged with Chrysler. Chrysler is a US company.

Further, the US company Applied Minds as widely publicized a variant of the Unimog called the Maximog. This Unimog has received press coverage (a Google search turns up articles on this project in the US newsmedia).

I believe that the Unimog sold more units and has a higher profile in the United States than in any other nation where English is the official language, though perhaps Canada could make a claim. I would like to hear whether others feel that the Unimog has a particularly strong association with Britain, Canada, India, Australia, or another country whose version of English is widely recognized?

English language provenance of the article
Item 2 above refers to the version of English used by the first major contribution to the article (excluding stubs).

I wrote the first version of this article in Sept 2002, and I think I could argue that this was a non-stub creation in American English. The article remained unexpanded until 2004, when other editors added content to it. These edits largely retained the American spelling, but (wisely) introduced metric measurements, which I believe are most strongly associated with Unimogs  I would be surprised if a German-engineered vehicle was built in terms of feet and pounds!

I'd like to open this up to comments  what do others think?"

This article seems to me about right in its focus on what English-speakers normally mean by """"banana"""", namely the food, where it comes from, what it is, how it's grown, etc. It would be possible to move some the taxonomy material to Musa (genus) perhaps, with some cross-referencing, so that the article concentrates more on the food and agricultural aspects of the topic, but this would be a marginal change.

PTC does not increase capacity except possibly on low density lines that were previously not signaled.  ACSES does not actually handle any sort of anti-colision duties.  Those are covered by the legacy fixed block cab and wayside signaling system.  On non-ACSES routes the PTC unit is attached to the wires leading to the wayside signal.  If reliable enough this can provide the same functionality as cab signals, but at a far higher price point. Just because wireless data is involves does not mean PTC is the same as moving block or CTBC.  Finally because of the reliance of wireless links, PTC systems are prone to disruption just like your cell phone or WiFi or digital TV signal.

I do however wish to bring your attention back to what was my original intent. I have observed this page frequently. Few years ago, I started wondering as to what is the acceptable time period for this page to remain hostage to the old statistics of Jeff Sonas, Raymond Keene, Nathan Divinsky, Matej Guid and Ivan Bratko. More recently I observed many past players (or their protege) beginning to exploit this page to proclaim greatness. My additions were merely an attempt to coerce a reflection on the """"present state"""" because """"Throughout History"""" seems to have stopped at 2005! The elo list only adds to the confusion because it is inflationary in nature. In my humble opinion, the present cathartic state is a bigger violation of encylopedia guidelines then my attempt to update it. Do remember that Wikipedia is visited by more lay people (who will be seriously mislead/confused by the data upto 2005) then experts (who can objectively transpose it to year 2011). A lot of 10 year old kids use Wikipedia to learn and write their homework. It is fine if we want to wait till someone of great repute explicitly compares current players to Fischer or either of the K's, or someone acceptable comes forth with up-to-date statistics beyond 2005. That may happen tomorrow, or may not happen for another 10 years. Till then we can keep our heads buried in sand.   """
0,"vulcanization is not synonymous with curing
After making the changing discussed immediately above, I reviewed the article further and find that this confusion is more deeply imbedded in this article.  The entire first paragraph equates vulcanization with any type of curing of sulfur - which is not the case.  Curing of rubber with some process has indeed been around for long before the Europeans discoved rubber, but the term vulcanization was coined specifically to refer to the curing process that involved the addition of sulfur at high temperatures."

With that new rule in mind, I have chosen the original Crash Bandicoot article as the article that I'll be group leader of. You put your name down for those three articles and I was wondering if you would like to be group leader of either Crash Bandicoot 2 or 3. Remember, you can only take one. The one that you don't choose will be removed from the list until I am finished editing the original Crash Bandicoot. I hope to be hearing from you sometime during the week.

Whenever you see brackets that means that the editor has added an explanation.  In this case [organic remains] was added to explain the word 'they'.  While W&M; used the word fossil in the previous sentence it is clear that they were referring to organic remains because by definition, recently buried remains (such as what is """"now occurring"""") are not fossils.  From the """"Dictionary of Geologic Terms"""", 3rd edition, 1984, by Bates and Johnson:  FOSSIL:  Any remains, trace, or imprint of a plant or animal that has been preserved in the earth's crust since some past geologic or prehistoric time.  Nothing buried in the present can be a fossil, for it is in historic time.  And further, you do not quickly bury fossils to preserve them, you quickly bury organic remains to protected them long enough so they they can eventually become fossils in some future geologic era.

W&M; likely used the term fossil loosely, like many editors of this WP page, to refer to organic remains that might become fossils per definition in some geologic era in the future.  It is unfortunate that W&M; were not as precise as they might have been, because uninformed people, such as Talk.Origins, misunderstand and twist what they said.

As much impact as W&M; have had on Creationary thought, nearly all fellow creationist today recognize that The Genesis Flood, is now way out of date.

 THF's conflict of interest and complaints

 Bloc voting 

Countries with large populations of non-nationals may have their televote influenced considerably. This has been cited as the reason for apparent bloc voting in the Balkan countries of the former Yugoslavia.[91] 

This is full-blown crazy. What does """"non-nationals"""" mean? These countries have similar cultures and speak the same languages. The stars in Croatia are popular in Serbia and vice versa. People are nationals of their countries in the largest proportion in each of those countries (there are some refugees in each of those countries, but that doesn't really explain why Croatia would always give the highest no. .of pts to Serbia, or Macedonia to Serbia, where there was no conflict to speak of). For example, I'm a Bosnian Serb and me voting for a Croatian or a Serbian song is not unusual. But I'm not a Bosnian non-national. I have the passport of BiH, and my family has never lived in Serbia in history. It's really about mutual intelligibility  which is why Scandinavian bloc votes for each other all the time.

Just to correct you, in america, hispanic and anglo are used as racial terms. Where do you come from that you don't recognize this? Again, just fo the record, europeans view non-white south americans as hispanic. Spaniards are not considered hispanic by european standards. 

And don't let these stupid americans fool you either! At one point, they considered jews and irish to be non-white, believe it or not. So, this speaks volumes of the ignorance of americans who don't even come close to europeans in culture, arts, language, science, fashion, etc.

 British Museum stuff 

I've removed:""""In the British Museum there is a genealogy in a manuscript of the Cottonian Collection showing a lineage of Gruffydd ap Cynan. It shows he is the father of Owain Gwynedd and the grandfather to Madawc (another spelling for Madoc). Also in the same collection is a Latin manuscript Vita Griffini Regis (The life of King Gruffydd) that says Gruffydd is the son of Cynan ab Iago and father to Owain Gwynedd - and Owain's son found unknown lands."""" Earlier I removed """"This manuscript as talked about in the Cottonian Collection has a date on it of 1477"""". 
First, there are quite a few Madocs/Madogs/Madawcs etc, so genealogies are of not much use here.
Secondly, why are we claiming that the manuscript says this without a link to it? There is an annotation that says """" Vita Griffini, filii Conani, regis Venedotiae vel Northwalliae, à Thelwello jurisperito Latine versa: ad finem carmina reperiuntur Meredithi de Madoco, filio Oweni Gwynnedd, et ejus navigatione ad terras incognitas; Wallice. Vixit Meredithus iste circa An. 1477"""". Note that this is not a date on the manuscript. We need a reliable source that has actually read the manuscript as the annotation fails as an RD (as clearly does Deacon. Until a reliable source reads  and comments on anything in it that might have to do with Madoc, this doesn't belong here.   """

 I have valid contributions - A quick review at  shows this is not the case.  In your month you have no notable contributions so your plea for the benefit of the doubt based on other contributions will fall on deaf ears.
 I have been here for a month - Irrelevant.  Especially given lack of productivity.

I.E., even if you are a totally new user, you have not set about improving the encyclopedia, which is the expectation.
 I am innocent - you have made more nonconstructive statements in your brief month as Bookish than is warranted.  Further, you seem to be trolling.
 I am only being targetted since I commented on that deletion article - The block reasons seem to be a.)suspected sockpuppet, b.)non-constructive edits.  Ask yourself, do you think constructive wikipedians want others around who seek attention by writing in such an unprofessional manner.  I actually gave thought to jesting in my response on the very AfD you were reprimanded for.  I don't like being involved in a debate with a person who doesn't help others to understand his position.  Your response could have been acceptable if you had said the version of the page that you voted on is crap because the x y and z claims are so baseless that they must be a joke.  The woman has a www.imdb.com page that is referenced on the page.  It is conceivable that because of its brevity you might have been confused about its veracity and validity.  However, she is noted in the msnbc.com page that you should have seen as referenced.  There is little reason to question whether a Veronica Finn exists meeting the description on the page version you saw.  The only way to improve the encyclopedia on contestable issues is if everyone attempts to enlighten others on why changes should be made.  Saying this page is crap does not help. 

 I apologize if the wrong conclusion has been reached regarding your editorship.  However, I believe it was correct and it is certainly supportable.  I support the original unblock denial.

 Wikipedia and copyright 
 Hello Jbeck8924, and welcome to Wikipedia. Your addition to 401 Derby has had to be removed, as it appears to have added copyrighted material without permission from the copyright holder. While we appreciate your contributing to Wikipedia, there are certain things you must keep in mind about using information from your sources to avoid copyright or plagiarism issues here.

You can only copy/translate a small amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double quotation marks ("""") and a cited source. You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Help:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase. Following the source's words too closely can create copyright problems, so it is not permitted here; see Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing. (There is a college-level introduction to paraphrase, with examples, hosted by the Online Writing Lab of Purdue.) Even when using your own words, you are still, however, asked to cite your sources to verify information and to demonstrate that the content is not original research. 
Our primary policy on using copyrighted content is Wikipedia:Copyrights. You may also want to review Wikipedia:Copy-paste. 
If you own the copyright to the source you want to copy or are a designated agent, you may be able to license that text so that we can publish it here. However, there are steps that must be taken to verify that license before you do. See Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials.
In very rare cases (that is, for sources that are public domain or compatibly licensed), it may be possible to include greater portions of a source text. However, please seek help at the help desk before adding such content to the article. 99.9% of sources may not be added in this way, so it is necessary to seek confirmation first. If you do confirm that a source is public domain or compatibly licensed, you will still need to provide full attribution; see Wikipedia:Plagiarism for the steps you need to follow.
Also note that Wikipedia articles may not be copied or translated without attribution. If you want to copy or translate from another Wikipedia project or article, you can, but please follow the steps in Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia.

*  *  *

I look at a lot of articles (such as BillCJ and many others and it reminds me of books that were published in the 1950 - lots and lots of facts boring, dull uninteresting pictures - picture with no history surrounding what is being published.  In the 1980-90's, a lot of True Aviation historians (i.e. Roger Freeman, Jeff Ethell, Warbirds Worldwide, etc..) found that aviation historians wanted and needed history recorded.  The captions of their books detailed who, what, when, where, etc...  As we progressed into the 2000's, I am finding that today’s writers unfortunately, want to dumb down the article - instead of giving all the details to allow the readers to decide how much level of detail he wants - Again, unfortunately, BillCJ (as well as others) want to take the Dick & Jane approach to aviation history.

This is suppose to be an online reference/encyclopedia - often when you Google an item, the wiki article is the first reference to pop-up so this will be (unfortunately) the first and only reference many will have for a subject.  A subject has to include everyone that references and item, whether it be a 4 year old doing his first model airplane, the aviation historian, the F-16 Buff.  These articles are also used by serious models who want the details.

Articles only tell part of the story - you need the pictures to compliment and point out what the article is discussing.  In the same vein, the pictures need the same level of detailed study (if possible) and care that is place in creating the entire article.  Having a great and fantastic article (such as the F-16) with kindergarten captions makes the entire article pointless.

It is also unfortunate that other editors like Askari Mark feels that detailed captions are meaningless to most readers - again, you can not have an online reference/encyclopedia without filling crossing the t and doting the i's.  Without detailed captions, it like having no reference section - sure you can print captions that state """" Gee an F-16 in Flight """" - especially when it is clear that the airplane is sitting on the ground.  Or the case of one article """"Aircraft is on a bomb-run"""" when it was clear from the picture that the bomb-bay doors were closed, no guns in the waist position and the detailed history showed the aircraft actually was a trainer and never left the United State...

BillCJ also mentioned """" are you seriously suggesting that """" serious historians """" only read WP articles for the pictures? """" - it is a proven fact that 90% of all information processed by humans come from Visual"""" data (i.e. pictures, etc...) - this is the reason Picture books are popular with preschoolers.  The first thing a majority humans look out when reading any thing is the pictures - if the pictures are interesting then many people will stop and read.  If an aviation historian comes across an article that details the subject matter then he will stop and read the contents.

It is also been said that this article is not for the F-16 Buffs - if this is the case, then 
 why have technical specifications
 why have details on each variation??  
 Why have the nuts and bolts of each individual user??
 Etc, Etc, Etc...
Why have detailed information regarding anything regarding the aircraft if this subject is not going to reach out to those who can say yes, this is true (i.e. the historian/buff) - If you are going to have the nuts and bolts in the article then you have to carry this same thought patterns over to have the nuts and bolts details in the photo captions.... (for example: B-52 Specifications, B-52 Costs, B-52 Variants) etc...  this type of informations IS for the Aviation Historian / Buff and generally not for the casual reader (which is MY point in having detailed captions).

If we dumbdown the photocaptions for the """"causual reader, then this level of details Specifications, costs, variations also needs to be removed as it will only confuse the """" casual reader """" and will lead to people calling all such information """" gobbledy-gook """".

If we dumbdown the photocaptions or call detailed information """" gobbledy-gook to most readers """" then terms such as: Wing area, Airfoil, Zero-lift drag coefficient, Drag area, Aspect ratio, Maximum speed:, Combat radius:, Ferry range, Service ceiling ,Rate of climb, Wing loading, Thrust/weight, Lift-to-drag ratio are """"gobbledy-gook to most non-aviation readers""""

The article under its previous name is referenced all over the web for some three years and should not be changed without due cause, else confusion results. 
According to Wikipedia a massacre is """"the intentional killing of a considerable number of human beings, under circumstances of atrocity or cruelty, or contrary to the usages of civilized people.""""

We should paraphrase if we need to, especially if it is a literal, rather than a meaning, translation from French as much of this appears to be. I think we need to forge a compromise between what is there now, and something  easier to grasp the true meaning of. I'll offer the following as a starter in this spirit:

Manufacturable and repeatable standards
Example physical standards of the base units used in the metric system capable of being accurately manufactured (known as realisable by the BIPM), ideally with reference to naturally occurring stable physical constants or phenomena rather than to a single existing physical object or artefacts. The BIPM publish a set of instructions for how to manufacture a reference standard for each of the base units. This is known as a mise en pratique in French, the primary language of the BIPM. Where practical at the time, the definitions of the base units were developed so that a suitably equipped laboratory would be able to construct an acceptably accurate reference standard without the need to compare it with an existing physical object, which may not be available locally. In practice, such such realisation is done under the auspices of what is known as a mutual acceptance arrangement (MAA).

Hi there! Thanks for the edit, I really appreciate you helping to improve the article.
I have something to say about your edit, however, and I wanted to take you aside a moment and work this out.

The problem sort of exists with the original too, and i've been trying to think what we can do about it.
See, a sizable chunk of people still do know it as 'the alien from alien', and our job is to correct those people when they look it up.

Its a problem with the article I was planning to tackle after the xenomorph issue was settled (if it went that way). The way you have phrased it sounds like its just some uncommon secondary name, which is not ideal, but neither was the way I did it.

Basically it needs to say """"You might know this as alien, but you would be wrong"""", but in wiki language. I've hit a brick wall with how to do that. I'm hoping you might have some ideas for that.

Do you think we could work out some nice sounding way to introduce the article a bit better than it currently does?

 Using talk pages 

Hey, there, and welcome to Wikipedia. Thanks for your time and contributions. Feel free to have a look at the community portal to learn more about contributing to our encyclopedia. I see things seem to have gotten off to a rough start, here, so just a quick note, here. If you would be so kind, please make use of talk pages to discuss controversial edits  see how to use a talk page. You should also feel very free to make use of Wikipedia's robust dispute resolution process. In the current situation, it appears that you and other editors are simply edit warring back and forth; it's really much better if these issues can be talked through. Thanks. –   """

0,"Regardless of what you believe, it's not part of the definition, so it shouldn't be phrased as such.  Now, apparently, you want me to teach you economics.  Fine.  Payment of wages for labor is an emergent phenomenon.  In free markets, a number of things happen.  Technology advances, which increases the return to sepcialization.  Interest rates and average profit margins decline.  Both of these make it harder for one person to have all the skills to competitively run all parts of the business.  So, people start to sell just the input they're (comparatively) best at. That gives people a much higher return for their efforts than investing money at 5% interest, or trying to do all functions of the production process well.

I'm surprised this list has survived and grown, but it seems to meet some need.  Given that it appears to be here to stay, yes, some change towards sortable table would help.  Layout-wise, if it was just a list of NRHPs, some of which are further designated NHLs, then a 3 or 4 column table would work to display the information.  There'd be columns for University, State, and NRHP name, perhaps with a """"type"""" column or with color coding for NHLs vs. regular NRHPs.  All 3 or 4 columns could be sortable.  However, some of the university historic districts listed here include sublists of contributing properties.  Not sure how those would work in a sortable table.  Mere contributing properties should not be made to appear to be equivalent in appearance to a NRHP.  Perhaps it could be done as a sortable list with one row per NRHP / NHL, and those sublists could just be included as blocks appearing in a description column?   """

 """"Countries"""" or """"Regions"""" 

From American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language for """"country"""":  """"1. a. A nation or state. b. The territory of a nation or state; land. c. The people of a nation or state; populace... 2. The land of a person's birth or citizenship...""""  And """"nation"""":  """"1. A relatively large group of people organized under a single, usually independent government; a country.  2.  The government of a sovereign state.""""  Thus the word """"country"""" in American English at least is bound up in the notion of sovereignty.  The use of """"country"""" in this title by a single editor is a legal artifact of the wording used to bind Scotland, Wales, etc. to the United Kingdom.  It is not a term in general use for administrative divisions, but a term of sovereignty for the majority of English speakers as evidenced by the dictionary definitions of """"country"""" and """"nation"""".  There is no insult intended for Scotland et al. by referring to them as Regions.  Actually, I think that """"Administrative Division"""" might be an even more accurate term for this section since non-administrative divisions are covered later. (  )"""

In the context of individual reactive passive components (e.g. inductors & capacitors), I'm familiar with the following definition: 

The aforementioned definition is presented, in some form, in section Individual reactive components of the article, however, the section Definition of the quality factor has no mentioning of it. Instead, the following definition is presented:

a definition which is practically the same as the other energy-based definition in the section, and furthermore, includes a reference to 
James W. Nilsson's Electric Circuits 1989 edition. I've went through a recent (much newer) edition of the book, and found no energy-based definition of any kind for Q - whether for resonator circuits or individual components.
I therefore tagged the reference as """"Failed verification"""", and additionally, I wonder what is the point of this definition, which is practically the same as the previous one in the article. It seems to me that one of them is superfluous.

How do you pronounce maize? - """"maze"""" (rhymes with days) or """"mize"""" (rhymes with eyes)?

My apologies - It appears that there is an attempt on the page to explain how to pronounce maize - there is an """"ei"""" reference where the """"ei"""" appears to be in a different font from the rest of the the sentence, and that corresponds to a rhyming with """"days"""" (i.e., not rhyming with """"eyes""""). But to the first-time reader this is easy to overlook. Perhaps with further experience with the Wikipedia pages, I will not be so quick to jump to these conclusions of inadequacy.  But for now, suffice it to say that a casual browser of these pages can quite easily make the same mistake(s) that I have.

Look:
I don't care where you took this chart from, remember well: Bulgarian has six vowels, SIX, SIX, SIX and NOT eight. There are four other allophones (two between a and @ and two between o and u), which appear in unstressed syllables depending on the position of the unstressed syllable to the stressed syllable within a certain word. If you are posting also allophones and not only phonemes (the reasonable question is why you are doing this but we'll deal with this some other time), then the vowel chart should include all ten of them and not only eight with information which is an allophone and which is a phoneme. But you don't know that, do you?

Then we get to another reasonable question: why do you think that you can erase the whole vowel section with the vowel descriptions? Ha? 

So: you post a chart which is WRONG and then you erase a section which is RIGHT. What the hell are you doing? I am getting tired of non-experts who read something somewhere and then come and try to wreak havoc on articles which they understand nothing about. A couple of months ago, one user was trying to change the article Bulgaria because he had read that the Bulgarians were descendants of the Shumers. In two words, your edit is pretty much of the same value and worth. For the phonetics section here, I've used the Routledge compendium on Slavic languages (1991) and the newest Bulgarian edition of New Bulgarian - phonetics, grammar and syntax. Please, consult any book on Bulgarian phonetics before you come again with this vowel chart."

 Éamonn McCann on RSF and Political Legacy of 1916 

ÉRSF 'AUTHENTIC CLAIMANTS TO POLITICAL LEGACY OF 1916 RISING' 

WRITING in the Sunday edition of the Derry Journal journalist and author Éamonn McCann said that in his view, as far as Republicanism was concerned, the most authentic claimants to the political legacy of the 1916 Rising were Ruairí Ó Brádaigh and Republican Sinn Féin. 

He said: """"The Proclamation didn't promise a fight to achieve the Republic. It proclaimed the Republic as an actually-existing entity. It is for this reason that IRA volunteers ever since have pledged not to strive for the achievement of the Republic but to defend the Republic already achieved. In this perspective, a deal which others might see as a step towards the ultimate objective will be seen as contemptible retreat from the struggle. 

""""In detaching himself from the Provisionals in 1986 because they'd accepted the legitimacy of the Leinster House parliament, Ó Brádaigh stood by the Republic established on Easter Monday. Looked at from this angle - as legitimate an angle as any other - there is no question: Mr Ó Brádaigh and his followers stand alone in true succession to Easter Week. 

""""Those of us who stand rights outside the Republican tradition and who take a socialist view also see Easter Week in the perspective of our own politics, see its enduring legacy in the fact that it was a blow against the most powerful Empire on earth at the time, and regard it as self-evident that its spirit is best represented today in the fight against the imperial power of the US ruling class. 

""""In this view, the most egregious betrayal of 1916 lies not in grudgingly taking seats in a partitionist parliament but in cheerfully breaking bread with George W Bush."""" 

The Sunday Journal also carried an article entitled """"We're the true inheritors of 1916""""' - Derry Republican Sinn Féin"""" on page 4. 

""""Plans by the Irish Government to celebrate the 1916 Easter Rising are hypocritical, a Derry Republican Sinn Féin (RSF) activist has suggested. 

Derry based spokesman for the movement, Richard Walsh says that RSF are the only true inheritors of the historic insurrection and the proclamation of independence. He hit out at the 26-County Administration for """"war-crimes"""" against those who believed in the ideals of the uprising during the Civil War. 

He said: """"There has been much talk of late about the legacy of the Easter Rising of 1916. 

""""Bertie Ahern has announced plans by the 26-County State to commemorate 1916 with a Free State military parade. 

""""Let no-one forget that it was the Free State Army that executed four Republican soldiers in Co. Donegal by firing squad in 1923 as a reprisal for Republican military operations. True Republicans commemorate the Drumboe Martyrs at Eastertide every year. 

""""The Staters were also responsible for many other war-crimes such as the Ballyseedy massacre in Co. Kerry (also in March, 1923), where eight Republican soldiers were killed whilst strapped to a landmine by Free State forces - miraculously leaving one survivor."""" 

He added that the 26-County government cannot claim ownership to the legacy of the Easter Rising. 

""""Those who not only betrayed the All-Ireland Republic - proclaimed in arms at Easter 1916, endorsed by the people of Ireland in 1918, and effectively established by Dáil Éireann in January, 1919 - but also actively waged war against it cannot claim the legacy of 1916. 

""""These people continue to imprison Republicans by using the Special non-jury Court in Dublin - the same building in which Robert Emmet was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered by the English - on the basis of the opinion of the 26-County police [Gardaí]."""" 

He added that the Republican Movement, on the other hand, had """"remained loyal to the Republic of Clarke; Mac Diarmada; Mac Donagh; Pearse; Ceannt; Connolly and Plunkett, and have commemorated the 1916 Rising every year since. 

""""Those who have maintained this continuity are the true inheritors of the noble ideals of 1916.""""  """

 Hi Marcuse. I see you've run into Sojambi Pinola. don't mind him, he's a buffoon. He is friend of Biff Rose's. They mention each other on their respective web spots. Looks like the two of them are on here basahing other people until they stand alone as edit king. Too bad someone else wrote about Rose's own anti semiticism, and racism. Poor Sojambi has been trying to fix it ever since. The sad thing is, he is so one sided, he has a difficult time persuading others of his NPOV- therefore he lashes out, and you were caught up in the crossfire(evidence here[]) Notice, he's only comparing what he wants you to see. the connection? well there isn't any really, but by creative use of wiki skills he tries to cover his own manipulations by using hanging you up as the villain. It's a rather typical obfuscation tehnique. By accusing every person who posts something that makes an edit to his work, he then marks them as a bad user. It's also reminiscent of those toubling Republican smear tactics of last year- only translated to this site. He's a schmuck. Claims to be latino, then claims to be jewish, then claims to be black, then claims to be white. Next he'll claim to be a woman. He's already claimed to be a few other people, and it was his vandalism of other peoples talk page and of the Rose page itself that got it frozen in the first place.

Bolsheviks? Are you suggesting that i shouldn't forcefully challenge the proposed introduction of the topic of Bolsheviks into this article??? That's roughly equivalent to the old red-baiting practice of calling union organizers commies.

But that's just one of the obvious examples, and therefore easy to challenge. An example of the more subtle bias that has crept in  the article has been edited to claim,

Union Busting is a term used by labor organizations and trade unions to describe the activities that may be undertaken by employers, their proxies, workers and in certain instances states and governments usually triggered by events such as picketing, card check, organizing, and strike actions...

In other words, the workers begin to organize, or the union takes some sort of concrete action, and there is a response.

Well, (the reader may conclude,) if the union advocates would just go away, everything would be peachy-keen.

But that doesn't hint at the reality faced by some of my friends and family who have worked at Wal-Mart, where even a vague rumor brings a special visit (together with their indoctrination program) the suits from their corporate union busting division. And they eavesdrop on phone and email conversations of their employees to pick out any such rumor. They've even used high tech bugs, and infiltrators to police their employees for any suggestion of concerted activity.

Or how about my nephew who worked as a chef for a major hotel chain; when a new corporate conglomerate bought out the chain, they issued an edict which they claimed was for """"the privacy of associates."""" Anyone employed at the hotel chain was no longer allowed to use the last name of any other employee, under any circumstances, except when required for official business. My nephew (who has never been a union activist) says it was an obvious new rule aimed at making it more difficult for employees to communicate with each other outside of their place of employment. He described it as pre-emptive union busting. Not in any sense a reaction to """"events such as picketing, card check, organizing, and strike actions..."""" 

In brief, this article used to be pretty well focused on the issue of union busting. But in some places it has been edited to create a false impression about the reality of union busting. I won't say the editors are biased, but the edits sure the heck are. Others may draw their own conclusions.   """

Nonsense. Yes of course there were constitutional amendments in July but those occurred all the time in the previous 45 years, they are hardly a relevant turning point of some sort.

:

 Sandstein apparently thinks that everything not being a compliment is ipso facto derogatory. There is also another possibility that hasn't crossed his mind: neutral. No English dictionary has (derogatory) or (offensive) label next to the definition of the word nationalist. However, in Sandstein's native language the word nationalist does have a derogatory undertone. Here is the link to the definition of Nationalismus in the most authoritative German dictionary (Duden), where it has a label (meist abwertend) which translates into English as """"mostly pejoratively"""". In German it's used as a pejorative, in English it isn't and it belongs to the neutral register. I suspect that Sandstein mixed two entirely different usage contexts for otherwise related words with the same meaning, in two different languages.
 It was not my intention to make any kind of personal attack. If you look at my edit history you can see that my behavior has been nothing short of exemplary. I have never heard anyone complaining about being offended by calling them nationalist. More often than not, it is I who is on the receiving end of abuse which sometimes provokes abrasive responses. If someone said that they are offended I would've stopped.
 Sandstein's condescending comment about me apparently failing to understand something (what?), justifying the """"educational"""" component of the block by such lack of understanding is borderline insulting. Perhaps Sandstain trains his dog by taking punitive measures when puppy does something wrong, but may I remind him that we're dealing with human actors here that are not Fachidioten with blinders that only respond to Pavlovian stimuli dispensed by the master with his block^Wstick. An administrator should not be making such comments when blocking other users. They shouldn't probably be thinking of editors as offenders that ought to be subject to corrective measures (blocks) for their infractions (policy violations), but at least they could keep it to themselves.
 OK, let's say I crossed the line with nationalist name-calling. I didn't mean to use derogatorily, but I can accept that it is not an appropriate conduct. But what does that have to do with ARBMAC and the excessively long block? As I far I can see the guidelines on the WP:PA require posting a message on user's talkpage and seeking mediation. None of that happened. PA is a community-approved policy which takes precedence over anything ArbCom decides, or any admin """"broadly interprets"""". A week is something that trolls and bad-faith editors get. Surely it's too excessive?
 This whole circus is a result of content dispute with the user who submitted the enforcement request. It was not made in good faith and his ulterior goal is to remove me from editing a set of low-importance articles that are currently not in a NPOV state. He also submitted a sockpuppet investigation against me with evidence such as last-year's sarcastic comment of mine on a sister project, as well as edits that I made years ago. With all that in mind, I must say that Wikipedia community has become very effective at giving partisan editors tools to target undesirable editors - a Byzantine collection of policies which admins overzealously enforce without a second thought, and without thinking of a big picture. Admins in fact are incentivized not to involve themselves, which basically gives the enforcement gun to POV-pushers which are intimately acquainted with all the glorious details of the relevant wikilese. I urge admins to think outside the policy-enforcing request-observing mode and think whether blocking me in any way helps to resolve the pending content disputes.   """

Sentence

Pardon me if I make a mistake here (I haven't had breakfast and I'm about to go out). Re: when speakers do make arguments to defend a usage, these arguments are often complicated by their reliance on false ideas on linguistic matters, such as the impression that an expression is newer than it really is. The reference only provides one example: """"accepted to college"""". As far as I've read, the false ideas of usage usually pertain to expressions that have not been in the standard language for long, but in a dialect form for longer. Sometimes even a usage might die out and then be revived again, to be defended on its age. Would not it not be clearer to elaborate on """"linguistic matters""""? It is difficult to guess them solely from one example (that an expression is newer than it actually is). If the sentence were clearer, it would easier to verify it.  """

0,"Parishan, the claim indeed is true and you are actually not saying the truth, the evidence above gives examples of dozens of articles, not one. And your claim of double standards was being brought which you failed to address convincingly. The Azeri term is the Turkic term; Jerusalem’s foreign names are there for a reason. All Persian, Urdu and Hindi qualify as such because they are relevant and present in several historic documents, maps and manuscripts influencing other languages words for the place. There is no proper Azeri distinct term for the place, it is the official Islamic term and the variants are either Turkish or Persian. We can write Jerusalem in Zulu language too, it doesn’t mean it has any historic or notable value. The evidence above documents that the edit happened in a period when you have found various articles where Armenian terms were present and added Azeri terms when it was not relevant. It was explained to you that the Armenian term for Jerusalem was present because there is an Armenian Quarter in Old Jerusalem and there are manuscripts dating back to a millennium and a half. As for the notability, if you’d have taken the time to read others concerns, you will actually remember one example, in which it was asked to you to provide another source while you were stuck to one article in Azerbaijani admitting to have nothing else. You’ve been contributing here for a very significant period of time and should have by now known what qualifies as notable. According to your standards, any college teacher would qualify. We have enough problems here to have to go through your articles’ creation and bring the notability issue.

You’ve retaliated on various circumstances on various cases and this was brought to you on many occasions. Do you feel the need to have your memory refreshed? You deleted Andranikpasha and expended the other article, much like you have added the entry of Armenia in the anti-Semitism article in the past as retaliation, or worked on a NAZI person as retaliation to Vartan’s point which you misinterpreted. Or when you retaliated to one article where an Armenian term was added by adding Azeri term in a dozen articles.

More on guarnello
""""GUARNELLO (M/F). Both a kind of linen or cotton textile, and the feminine garment constructed from such a fabric.... The guarnello, rascia or saia is the standard form of dress for angels. It is worn by children as a simple, washable garment, and possibly also by pregnant women. There are also examples of guarnelli listed under items of male clothing."""" - Dress in Renaissance Italy, 1400-1500, by Jacqueline Herald, Humanities Press: NJ, 1981, quoted here

The coarse overdress for working women definition is from The World of Renaissance Florence by Francesco Adorno, Translated by W. Darwell, Giunti, 1999, ISBN 8809013492.
page 80

This site says:
A loose, sheer overdress (worn over a regular dress), was used at home and after birth - hence very few depictions of such garbs exist. Some has argued that it is not too unlike the sheer chemise like garbs Botticelli's """"Three graces"""" wears in his """"Primavera"""", but it can also be seen in his portrait of """"Smeralda Brandini"""" in London.

That may also be following Herald, which is listed as one of the sources.

The fabric is also translated as """"fustian"""" which would seem to be the coarser variety.

And here's the kicker: An article in the Globe and Mail (quoted with the crucial next line here) says
Mona Lisa had recently given birth to a baby, a team of Canadian and French scientists announced Tuesday, so her mysterious smile may have expressed the weary joy of a mother with a newborn. Using infrared technology that allowed them to see beneath a layer of varnish, the researchers found that Leonardo da Vinci's model had a gauzy layer over her dress they say was typically worn by pregnant women of the time, or mothers who had recently given birth. The filmy robe was called a guarnello.

I don't have the information on any other animal powered production facilities, but you mention that you found two or three references to animal power in 1400. Why not add them? They're part of history. Perhaps the framework of your date titling system in Cotton Mill is rubbish and needs to be changed, because no matter what stance we take here, the article is clearly missing information that could be incorporated. Providing only the information there allows people to make incorrect inferences.

In the context of Cotton Mill, are we to add an animal-powered category, or are we going to omit that from history?

The above is highly negative behavior,  abuse of the blocks system,  a """"personal attack"""" on its face, reflects negatively on WikiPedia and its environment,  contradicts the """"blocks are a last resort to prevent (true) disruption,  use discussion first"""" policy,  and seems to be an attempt to suppress discussion of dissenting ideas on various policies or just plain,  Diannaa's reaction to being disagreed with.

In the end,  threats,  including threats of blocks,  are not discussion.  If one says """"well,  the rules aren't so clear,  let's talk about this"""" and gets back,  """"you're violating the rules,  I'll block you!!!"""",  then the system isn't working.  If one replies to the previous,  """"let's take it to talk,  let's discuss"""" and gets in return """"there's nothing to discuss"""" ... well,  I've read WP's policy documents,  and you may disagree with me,  but I think they could use some revision and clarification.

That's where this dispute began,  and how we got here.  One should not be blocked,  for expressing a contrary opinion in discussion,  on one's own talk page,  and informing an editor or administrator that one finds their actions abusive.  One should not be blocked,  for expressing a contrary opinion in discussion,  on one's own talk page,  by the person one is debating.

In the end,  what's the rationale here?  What ongoing disruption or pattern of abuse is this designed to prevent?  That I'll post disagreement on my talk page?!?  One is supposed to *think* before issuing a ban,  not fly off the handle!  This is personal retaliation there's no ongoing abuse or disruption,  other than some strongly-worded opposition to the current phrasing of the abuse policy,  itself quite far away from """"using disruption to make a point.""""

At the top of this section Funkynusayri said """"this article should rather be called Nordic race with Nordic supremacy theory as a sub-section of it"""". That's not an objection to merging, it's an argument in favour of merging, with one aspect contained within another in the same article. We all know that there was historical concept of a 'Nordic race'. No-one disputes that. The question is whether there is any point having a separate article about it, distinct from the cultural and ideological uses to which it has been put. If both can managably be contained in the same article, then they should be. The Mediterranean race article contains both aspects, and so should this one. The title is rather a separate question. Nordic theory is a name that was created by user:fastfission to merge the term Nordic race with the idea that the concept became historically significant because there were specific theories about it. After all, that's what makes this page different from the others. This topic has a long, sometimes acrimonious, Talk page. If you look up Mediterranean race there is far less discussion, and there is almost none on Alpine race or Dinaric race. I don't mind what the title is, but the difference in title does reflect the reality that theories about this issue have been historically and ideologically significant, while theories about other European """"sub-races"""" have been purely academic.

0,"Why do girls lie all the time?! 

Well I can tell you something that bugs me so bad about my sisters and their friends.
They lie about EVERYTHING! EVERYTHING! And they always get away with it.
For example, my sister threw a shoe at me, it slammed into my face and she claimed it hit me in the stomach. How the crap would she know? She wasn't the one that got hit.
Anyways, when they lie they do get away with it. Which is why I'm going to answer this question now. 

Girls lie so they don't have to get in trouble, girls hate getting in trouble and then they rebel when they get grounded and a lot of fighting goes on. Also they'd always rather have their friend or another person in trouble but them. So take this for example, Tashya (made up the name) does something bad. And she knows she'll get in trouble for it. So when her mom or dad finds out she blames it on her brother. And her brother gets yelled at and grounded for her fault. Girls also love it when other people get in trouble.
So I answered my question."

 A few comments on the article 
Good article overall, but in reading through it I think that certain areas are in need of improvement. Firstly I thought there wasn't really enough explanation of why it would be preferable to build a Space elevator. The economics section has info on costs and all, but this is rather brief and comes towards the end of the article, I would think that explaining the perceived necessity of such a device would be one of the first things to state.
There were some things about the specifics of the engineering which I think need a lot more explaining, for one, is it proposed that the cable be a single thick wire or many tiny thin ones? It seems to be talked about at various points as if it could be either, so I think that needs more clarity.
Something quite important that I don't think was addressed at all (or at-least I couldn't see it) was the issue of how exactly the cable (or the whole structure) actually gets up into space in the first place. Are we to assume that the cable will be towed up by a rocket or something? If not that, then how?
Several times in the article it is mentioned that the """"Counterweight"""", could be an asteroid or a space station. But these two things are very different aren't they? I mean in terms of mass, an asteroid probably weighs millions if not billions of tons, whereas a manmade space stations would be only a few hundred or thousand tons (unless some gargantuan station is proposed). So how can these to things be comparable? And what kind of actual weights will be involved?
Finally the article doesn't give much information on how the climbers are proposed to move. It is mentioned further down that Magnetic levitation might be used, but is that the norm, is that what they all propose? Or are there different plans, like just mechanical wheels, etc?
Well that's about all I can think of for now, I hope the article can be improved with some of these suggestions.  """

 Misinformation in the ride description for California Adventure? 

I believe (though I can't prove it) that there are several misstatements in the ride description for California Adventure. The article describes an exact series of drops and rises, but I believer the ride is actually different each time (as is the ride in Florida). I was on it yesterday, rode it twice in a row, and the two rides were very different. I have ridden it several dozen times since it opened, and it has always seemed to be a variable ride. Second, the article says that the elevator unloads in a different place from where it loads, but I wonder about that. On a previous trip I was accompanied by a person in a wheelchair. We left the wheelchair at the immediate entrance to the elevator, after passing through the """"doors"""", and it was waiting for us in the same position when we disembarked. I suppose it's possible that the cast transported it to a different level while we were on the ride.   """

2) Danzig is nt just German name. It's also name by which still the city is known in English world, although the fact probably will change in the future. Therefore it's reasonable to mention both names

Hi Philip. I see you reverted my change, without responding to the reason I gave. Basically my thinking is, there is no single definition of what a mercenary is, so the section on Gurkha and FFL needs to say according to which definition/s they aren't considered mercenaries.
If their is some fundamental law of nature saying they aren't mercs, then why include them in the article on mercenaries at all? (Anymore than a section in the Birds article called Dogs are not birds). 
Presumably it is included because there is some sort of controversy, and as written it seems very POV.

Hi Ram.  I patrol new pages and often run into new articles that contain copyright violations.  Recently, I've found 4 or 5 of them that were created by students in your program.

Real aviation historians want details - I say as a aviation historian that if you have a photo then you have to give its history.  Bill say that this information should be spelled out in the artile, fine - lets delete all photo captions and go back to cave paintings.

Yes I am not sure best how to proceed here. One of the problems with consistency is that generally the most commonly reported numbers are the general opinion as I understand the matter. Two of the ways we could proceed are either 

I. Add a column noting that these are the """"most likely voting numbers"""" or however you want to label it and the other as """"general opinion"""". This can result in updating the current chart where you may have to list one or more numbers for each poll which is kind of problematic.

whatever....I did NOT say I would edit war, in fact I said I would be careful NOT actually edit war, but to simply place a word that belongs in the article, that Nova keeps having issues with.   Are you saying that I don't have the right in the """"future"""" to ever put in anything simply cuz Nova would object?     My hands would have to be tied, you're saying??

I don't like how you jumped the gun and twisted what I said around, where I specifically said I would NOT """"edit war"""", but would not put up with suppression of facts, simply cuz Nova doesn't like them. Also, the """"personal attacks"""" are merely facts about this individual that can be easily looked up. I'm not the only one who doesn't like him or what he does.    Actually at this point I don't care...I'm tired of the insanity.....I have other things to do, and this nonsense is too time-consuming anyway.  For real.   This person Nova made it """"personal"""" long before I did, with his actions.    Again, there are others who feel the same way....  I'm not the only one he's upset with his constant edit warring and disrespect.  So you looking only at me, and misunderstanding my words and my intent.    I was seriously planning to be done with Wikipedia for a long while anyway. (I have other accounts and even other IPs anyway.....but I probably won't even use them, as I don't really care to be wasting time on this stuff, anymore.)  Nova has no business on Wikipedia. He's an insufferable joke.  And I don't care that it's a personal attack. Since I'm blocked anyway, I might as well make it worth it.   He should just get lost from all articles, he adds nothing but aggravation and a barrage of insanity.    

Again, I'm NOT the only one who's been a victim of his crazy nonsense.    Yet that nutball stays unblocked, yet he is the CAUSE of it all the problems.    Interesting.  As I said, whatever.....I contributed a lot to WP in 5 short months (my first edit in Feb 2008 does not count, as that was just playing around....I got serious with WP in February 2010....)....with meaningful additions, corrections, source editing, vandalism removal, grammar correction, section adding, creation of a few articles.....etc.   I never even intended to get into this, it was all an accident when I couldn't find some topics on WP that I thought would be, so I decided to create some articles....and then get caught up in this stuff.   Much to my chagrin.   I have better (for real) things to do.    I don't care that much that I'm blocked......but it's the principle that it's sort of unfair, and you misunderstand (and actually twisted) my words around.....and this maniac (more personal attacks, so I'm making it good) gets off basically scott-free.......EVEN THOUGH I CAN SHOW YOU EXAMPLES OF WHERE HE'S BEEN AN INSUFFERABLE TARD WITH OTHER PEOPLE TOO.    You'll overlook that of course.     Cuz Nova knows how to manipulate WP and WP Admins fairly well, I've noticed.    Though I know that some Admins see his nonsense too.    

Anyway, again.....to re-iterate.....I did not say I would """"edit war"""" but would simply exercise my rights to put in words in an article, despite Nova's own constant edit warring and neurotic objections to everything.    And I said I would be careful NOT to violate 3RR as well as NOT brazenly """"edit war"""".     Of course you see it as a threat to """"edit war"""" anyway...  Me simply saying I will not stand for whole words to be removed, even if they're accurate, simply because ONE editor does not like it.    """

Reiser3 was an advanced filesystem, in its time, but is beginning to show its age.

Reiser4, the replacement Reiser3, is truly cutting edge, an outstanding filesystem.

To get some idea of how good Reiser4 really is, you should consider the following test results.
The first column names the filesystem tested.
The second column records the total time (in seconds) it took to run the filesystem benchmarking software bonnie++ (Version 1.93c).
The third column records the total number of megabytes needed to store 655 megabytes of raw data.

I think """"activist"""" is a fair factual description of some of Sotomayor's activities at Princeton and (to a lesser extent) at Yale, but without the context that is present later in the article, the sentence in the lede sort of leaps out, and suggests something quite different from what it turns out to be (i.e. sit-ins, protests, 60s-style """"activism,"""" militancy, that sort of thing).  That's not what you mean by the word in this context, but the reader won't know that before reading the full article, which is getting pretty long.  Also, it's not clear to me that this activism is important enough to make the lede anyway.

What do you think?

Hey there buddy, I am back:

(a quote from Kenneth Tennyson Phd.)

""""the sad thing is that our fellow here - freedom skies - appears to have been raised in america or britain and yet he seems more indian than american or british and along with that supports a radical view of the world that is peppered religious ideas... and along with that - he is educated! It is truly sad... if india industrializes and this hindutva movement holds sway, the world will see a flourishing of a very powerful and scary radicalized country.""""

Firstly, can you tell me what being American or British is? America and Britain are both made of of various immigrant and former immigrant communities from Italy, Ireland, China, Guatemala, and so forth. So, if Freedom Skies is being proud of his culture, is that evil? Secondly, you have an over negative estimation of countries outside of your clouded world. Suggestion, join the Marine Corps. That is one thing I have learned is understanding the world through travel. Thirdly, I am utterly shocked at your comment on Freedom skies being educated as being a sad thing (if not, a scary thing). Does that threaten you that Indians are educated? Please answer yes or no (no need to give a disertation or oration), thank you. Also, that statement reminds me of when the slaveowners back in the Southern part of America during the civil war used to consider Blacks getting education as a threat to their lifestyle. As a matter of fact, it was illegal for an Afro-American to go to school or even learn to read, since it was viewed as a threat to the racist slave owners. I will even go a further step to say that back then, these racists from the colonial South felt threatened that the slaves would become """"a very powerful and scary radicalized community"""".  

Regarding your previous posts, here is some food for thought. In the Marine Corps, as a Gunny Sgt. or someone in command, if you are at a bar or a party, you never show that you are drunk. If you are drunk, you do not admit it... You're basically shooting yourself in the foot by admitting that you have had a few drinks while fiddling around on wikipedia, (and in some cases, 3 cases???) learn from that pal..."""

No, Ketuanan Melayu was NEVER mentioned in the Constitution. It only mentions about """"Hak Keistimewaan orang Melayu"""". This is nothing but just the mentioned """"Aborigin Rights"""" just like most other countries, like Canada and Singapore. """"Ketuanan Melayu"""" was invented, but I'm not sure when is it exactly that it was first being used. One may say it is a derivation from the Article 153, but it has gone too far from beneficial - it has been abused and being used as a tool by Barisan Nasional for their own gain. The rationale behind Hak Keistimewaan Orang Melayu is that what they claimed that Malays are the Aborigins (although I don't really agree with this, the Peranakans has settled in Malacca during the 15th centuries!) - the true Aborigins are none other than Orang Aslis. Let's assume that the fact that Malays are aborigins are true. Article 153 never introduced """"Malays First"""" Policy, but rather the means to protect Malay rights as well as the rights of other races in this country. Article 153 is never controversial, but rather being ABUSED by certain politicians. I hope these makes it clear. The most prominent example that happens in this country right now is the government scholarship. You can read almost everywhere about this. Isn't this already an official discrimination? You can read more like the BTN courses who always refers the Chinese (include Peranakan generations) and Indians as """"pendatang"""", but the fact is that Parameswara himself is a Pendatang, (and also Khir Toyo).

Although Malaysia is not officially an Enthnocracy, but we can see that Malaysia appears to be one. Enthocracy is not limited to particular race in government positions, but it refers also to racial policies and practises. The definition of Ethnocracy includes """"and use them to advance the position of their particular ethnic group(s) to the detriment of others"""". Under the Malays First Policy (NEP, MARA, and many more) this is indeed very clear without further elaboration.

I do feel that Jews are screwing up the planet (though admittedly Muslims, by far, surpass the Jews in their capacity to destroy things). Look at history. Only recently has it become the norm to like Jews. That only came about after certain countries (eg America) adopted them as the collective dame-in-distress needing shelter and protection. Sort of the precursor to the chihuahua. Before then, Jews were hated in Europe and America alike..And everywhere else. We all know Jews were once banished from most culturally superior European countries. The only reason why Poland took them in was that they had loads of money. Probably the same reason why Washington panders to the now. Point is, alot of people dislike Jews. I'm entitled to, so long as I don't demonstrate that dislike on articles dealing with the topic of Jews. We don't penalize people for not liking things, do we? His Excellency...

0,"If you read the most thorough and credible works on the subject (see below), you will see that not only did the so-called Zebra murders flow directly from NOI theology, but that they were an NOI operation, directed from Chicago (aka New Mecca), and run out of the San Francisco mosque. The San Francisco death squad had pep rallies run by dignitaries from New Mecca after hours at the NOI-owned moving and storage where most of the killers worked, and all of them worked for NOI-owned businesses.

The apprentice Death Angels had to reach a certain quota from killing either four white children, five white women, or nine white men, in order to become full-fledge Death Angels, and receive free passage to Mecca. The practice of paying free passage to Mecca for killing “white devils” had been  instituted during the early 1930s by NOI founder Wallace Fard.

The NOI even paid for the defense of the three killers who refused to confess (Larry Green, J.C.X. Simon, and Manuel Moore), but refused to pay legal fees for the one killer, Jesse Lee Cooks, who confessed to murder (the Frances Rose killing), and went so far as to disown Cooks. The NOI considers it a mortal sin to confess to any crime in the white man's courts.

To get an indication of how tightly the NOI operation was run, the case was only broken when one of the killers, Anthony Cornelius Harris, came forward, in order to collect the $35,000 reward, get police protection, and new identities for himself and his family. One day, when Harris & Family were in a motel under police guard, and Harris was in the shower, his foolish wife telephoned the wife of her minister, at the San Francisco mosque, and told her where they were holed up. In no time flat, a squad of NOI assassins (Fruit of Islam types, not the raggedy characters in the “Zebra” death squads) showed up at the motel, and Detectives Gus Coreris and John Fotinos just managed to escape with the Harris family seconds ahead of the assassins.

Had the squad managed to kill Harris, the SFPD would never have broken the San Francisco cases (or at least, the 15 official San Francisco cases; there were more killings than that in the city by the bay). As it is, the convictions of Larry Green, J.C.X. Simon, Manuel Moore and Jesse Lee Cooks “cleared” only 15 killings, and the SFPD was convinced that at least three other men were part of the SF squad alone. However, the San Francisco DA, convinced that it had too little evidence to go to trial against the other three, dropped the charges against them.

The NOI is so tightly knit in its devotion to killing whites, whom it variously teaches are “white devils,” “blue-eyed devils,” and “grafted snakes,” that no one else came forward with information.
 
Not only did the NOI organize the death squads (there were many more than the one that went down), but the killings went on up and down the State of California, with different squads working different areas, and according to the FBI, even (though apparently, or rather, hopefully, to a lesser degree) on the East Coast. Dick Walley, the head of the Intelligence Analysis Unit at the California Department of Justice, had a dossier of 71 black-on-white murders committed across the state that he was convinced were NOI killings (Howard). (Walley died of cancer before the trial.) Clark Howard, the author of Zebra, was convinced that the NOI had murdered “just under 270” whites across California, but never named the other 255 victims, or explained his rationale. Since the murders were through and through an NOI operation, and only a small minority of them (even using Walley’s figure, which did not count non-California NOI racial killings) were committed in San Francisco, I suggest that we dispense with calling them the “Zebra Murders,” and simply call them the NOI Murders.

Contrary to those who have claimed that the NOI was seeking with the killings to cause a race war, the NOI was prosecuting a race war. The real story of how that war was stopped is one that I’m afraid we’ll never learn.

 The house in question is in Bethlehem according to two gospels and a prophecy.  
 Although the place of birth is disputed (and, I think, it is generally thought the original gospels had him being born in Nazareth) the passages about Mary and Joseph staying in a house/stable relate to a supposed trip to Bethlehem.  
 Bethlehem is a long way from Nazareth

GA Sweeps Review: On Hold
As part of the WikiProject Good Articles, we're doing sweeps to go over all of the current GAs and see if they still meet the GA criteria. I'm specifically going over all of the """"World History-Americas"""" articles. I believe the article currently meets the majority of the criteria and should remain listed as a Good article. In reviewing the article, I have found there are some issues that may need to be addressed. I have made multiple corrections and have included several points below that need to be addressed for the article to remain a GA. Please address them within seven days and if progress is being made then the article will remain listed as a Good article. Otherwise, it may be delisted. If improved after it has been delisted, it may be nominated at WP:GAN. Here are the points that need to be addressed:
Expand the lead to better summarize the article. It should mention a little bit about each heading within the article. The current two sentences isn't sufficient in describing the article. For guidelines, see WP:LEAD. The first paragraph in the background sections reads like part of the lead, consider rewording part of it and merging it into the current lead.
""""Many subsequent historians have considered the causes of the duel to be flimsy and have thus either characterized Hamilton as """"suicidal"""", Burr as """"malicious and murderous,"""" or both."""" Single sentence shouldn't stand alone. Either expand on it or incorporate it into another paragraph. Go through the rest of the article and fix any other occurrences.
""""When the original pistol was examined, the concealed hair trigger was discovered. (Reference: """"Pistols shed light on famed duel,"""" Smithsonian magazine, November 1976)"""" This reference should be converted to an inline citation.
This is not required, but consider converting the url inline citations to the templates used at WP:CITET.

Needs inline citations:
""""The most famous duel in American history..."""" If this is going to be stated a citation needs to be included.
""""...partook in """"hooliganish"""" behavior in..."""" If """"hooliganish"""" is in quotation marks, then it needs to have a source directly after the sentence.
""""There, after much debate and tight gridlocking, the influence of Alexander Hamilton, a very respected Federalist persuaded Federalists that Jefferson was the lesser of two evils.""""
""""It claimed to describe """"a still more despicable opinion which General Hamilton has expressed of Mr. Burr"""" at a political dinner.""""
""""In a letter delivered by William P. Van Ness, Burr demanded """"a prompt and unqualified acknowledgement or denial of the use of any expression which would warrant the assertion of Dr. Cooper"""".""""
""""The bullet ricocheted off Hamilton's second or third false rib—fracturing it—and caused considerable damage to his internal organs, particularly his liver and diaphragm before becoming lodged in his first or second lumbar vertebra.""""
""""...“Pendleton knows I did not mean to fire at Col. Burr the first time”.""""
""""In addition, Hamilton had been reported as having severe mood swings, characteristic of a manic-depressive starting as early as 1800. If Hamilton was indeed manic-depressive, his intentions for dueling with Burr may have been psychologically delusional.""""
""""the same pair which had once shot a button off of Aaron Burr's coat some five years earlier during a duel with Hamilton's brother-in-law""""
""""The guns are on display in the Executive Conference center of 277 Park Avenue in Manhattan.""""

 Remedies 

These were removed from the article. While I agree that this had developed severe listcruft, surely some citations exist for some of these. Moved to talk page so people have an idea what to search for.
Potentially beneficial remedies
Aspirin: - acetylsalicylic acid, taken before turning in to bed (before, not after sleeping), might be effective.
 Consuming 3 grams of Butyl hydroxy toluen (BHT) prior to drinking is said to counter hangovers, by detoxifying acetaldehyde (presumably replacing gluthatione.)  BHT in this case is supposed to also block alcohol metabolism, so the person will stay drunk longer.
 Another possible remedy is the consumption of motion-sickness medicine or over the counter allergy medicine.  Specifially, consuming cetirizine prior to consuming alcohol is reported to counter the hangover.
Supposed remedies

Note: Most of these have not been scientifically tested or reviewed in the above articles.
 Water: this has been recommended scientifically. Hangovers are mainly dehydration; therefore drinking water before, during and after a drinking session will greatly decrease any hangover symptoms. A glass of water between each alcoholic drink is the best way to reduce hangover, as you won't easily become dehydrated; this also causes you to drink fewer alcoholic beverages. Drink as much water before sleeping as possible (within reason). It may not totally prevent a hangover but it will reduce headache. Continuing to drink water may help to alleviate symptoms more quickly.
 Nux vomica (homeopathic remedy)
 Milk Thistle
 Angostura bitters and soda water
 Defecation
 Vomiting
 Professional massage, reflexology (foot), and other detoxifying practices.
 A glass of buttermilk. Though many people dislike buttermilk, it will calm down your stomach and add liquid to the body.
 Having sex (or masturbation) may increase the release of endorphins, which in turn may help reduce the effect of a hangover.
 Drinking coffee or other caffeinated beverages.  Caffeine increases the effectiveness of analgesics, and therefore may reduce headache severity when used with aspirin or similar medicines.  Coffee has also been shown in some studies to have a protective effect on the liver, effective in preventing alcoholic liver disease. (Caffeine is a diuretic, which would further dehydrate the body. This is generally not a recommended remedy. Thus, tea, especially green tea, is indicated.)
 Nicotine, once again much like caffeine, increases the effectiveness of analgesics and its stimulant effects diminishes many hangover symptoms.
 Cabbage leaves or tomato juice
 Bloody Mary
 Michelada (popular in Mexico; one part tomato juice, one part beer, a few drops of Worcestershire sauce and/or Maggi sauce or Soy sauce)
 Mixing in a tall glass two raw eggs with pepper, Tabasco sauce, and gin. Although the cysteine in the egg yolk may have a mild benefit, the pepper, Tabasco, and gin will have a negative impact.  Colloquially known as a """"Prairie Oyster"""".
 Drinking more alcohol is scientifically proven (see hair of the dog), a well-liked remedy. This will, however, only delay the hangover 
 Eating seafood is a popular """"remedy"""" in Chile.
 Coca Cola or Pepsi-Cola, otherwise known as """"Black Aspirin"""" (popular in Australia), also """"The Red Ambulance"""" (South African); the caffeine, bubbles and sugar can be easier to hold down than pure water.  Moreover, the low pH helps the enzymes in the stomach and the sucrose partially compensates the inhibition of the gluconeogenesis. 
 Taking a shower and oscillating between extreme cold and hot temperatures.  This practice has no effect on the hangover and can be unhealthy. Seen in the movie The Princess Bride.
 Eating canned asparagus before going to bed, purportedly a good cure thanks to the diuretic effects of asparagus.  Again, diuretics compound the problem.
 Ginseng tea is given to relieve the effects of alcohol.  If useful, it may be for its antioxidant and-or vasodilatation / microcirculation properties.
 Drinking a couple of table spoons of olive oil is said to be of great help

Common folk medicine has a wide variety of supposed hangover cures. A good hangover cure should replace essential nutrients lost by the body while counteracting the influence of residual poisons; very few cures do both at once. Among the more common proposed cures are:

Thanks for updating me on what a conflict of interest is. I know what it means. I have read somewhere on wikipedia that if it appears that a contributor is only writing about one subject, there is likely a conflict of interest. This is a fairly broad and unfair generalization. 

I happen to have noticed a hole where a wikipedia page ought to be, filled it, and now any subsequent activity related to this subject comes from pride for my work in this instance, specifically to make the best wikipedia page or pages I can.

 From the Wikipedia deletion guidelines:

Deletion process

    Main article: Wikipedia:Deletion policy

Deletion of articles from Wikipedia occurs through one of three processes.

     2. Another quick method is the use of proposed deletion: simply add 
 to the top of the article. This is meant for articles where the deletion is believed to be uncontroversial, yet does not meet the criteria for speedy deletion. A proposed deletion can be contested by any user by removing the  tag within five days, and if anyone still wants the article deleted the full AFD process is required.

I thought I complied with this policy, it seems to say that """"any user"""" can """"contest"""" the proposal by """"removing"""" the tag. It seems obvious that this article easily meets the criteria for notabilitythe stated reason for deletion. Beyond meeting the criteria's specifics, the criteria also has a catchall inclusion rule that the mere fact that an article does not meet specific criteria is not a sufficient reason to delete it.

I believe that the proposal to delete this article was made in retaliation against me personally and was not made in good faith to further the goals of Wikipedia, and that the proposal to delete, along with the reasons given, which I believe are not in good faith, therefore violates various Wikipedia policies.

The evidence for this belief includes (1) the proximity in time to an unrelated disagreement with the user proposing deletion; (2) the user's prior lack of interest or contribution or current knowledge of (as demonstrated by his reasons or comments) to the subject of the article proposed for deletion; (3) the fact that I have worked on this article in the past; (4) the fact that this user on or about the same day and time, in close proximity to the unrelated dispute with me, proposed two other articles that I have worked on that the user also has not previously or currently demonstrated any knowledge of or interest in; (5) proposed such articles for speedy deletion and then before I or anyone else had a chance to object (Wikipedia is not a full time job for most users, who only visit the site from time to time, and note also the stated policy that there are """"no emergencies on Wikipedia,"""" the user decided not to wait for any objections or to follow the policy of allowing the stated time period to pass, redirected the article to another article, effectively deleting the original article. In fact the redirect was effect as I was typing out an objection to the deletion with a reasoned explanation on why it should stay, and when I hit save, the article was gone and my objection and response are now lost; (6) he gave me three rapid succession warnings (in bad faith, for what I believe were good faith acts on my part) and had me blocked before I could make a response to his """"warnings""""; it appears that he has dome similar things in the past to other users.

It seems quite clear in light of the above, and further facts that can be marshalled in support, that this user's intent is (1) not supported by facts or policies, (2) not in good faith, (3) in retaliation, and therefore (5) in violation of Wikipedia policy.

Recognizing this, I communicated to this user that I would refrain from any activity that was the subject of the origial unrelated disagreement, by not making any further comment on the talk page of Tort Reform. I had hoped that this would resolve that dispute but it has not, as the user had made the dispute personal.

As for my being blocked by you as per the 3-revert rule, I must point out that I do not believe the rule applies to what I did, because I was (1) making a good faith effort to resolve the dispute by asking the user to stop his vandalism and disruption, (2) the posts involved were all on his talk pagethe most appropriate place to discuss a user's (his) apparent violations; (3) rather than reply, he deleted the warnings and requests to stop; (4) did so more than three times, in violation of the rule; (5) in bad faith, turned the rule on meI did not delete anything, and technically, I did not revert anything either, I think, but was adding to previous posts, and merely included the previously deleted material as support for a NEW post.

Other indications of bad faith:

The user asserts that I committed """"vandalism"""" to the entry on Sonic's Rendezvous Band by removing the delete tags. My reply is (1) I did so in accordance with policy; (2) it is not """"vandalism"""" to remove"

you're wrong; IAR applies to admins and regular editors alike. 
 
You have provided no evidence of that.    As I said,   I have the facts and you guys just have bullshit.
 
What is a """"regular"""" editor?    I am not a """"regular"""" editor  I am an occasional editor.
 
The """"Ignore All Rules"""" rule does not mean there can be one set of rule exceptions for you and another set of rule exceptions for me.     We can agree on an exception to the rules,  but the exception must apply equally to both of us.   For example,   we could agree that it is OK here to break the Wikipedia rule against using personal blogs as sources.    But that would mean that links to my blog must be allowed here and could not be excluded by arbitrary,  discriminatory distinctions between """"crappy"""" personal blogs and """"reputable"""" personal blogs.

Comment.  The nomenclature on Wikipedia seems to be to use the word """"painters"""" to describe fine artists whose medium is paint.  Category: Painters and its subcategories, and virtually all its subcats and daughter articles use the word """"painter"""" with that meaning. I appreciate what CoolCat is saying but to me it seems that the choice of the word """"painter"""" is a matter for general naming policy rather than discussion on RM. |Talk 12:03, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)"""

Half American and half Palestinian, Naomi Shihab Nye is an amazing figure paving the way for other ethnic poets. Starting at the age of seven, she is a song writer and a novelist who often writes about the small details of life that we take for granted. Even though she regards herself as a “wandering poet”, she refers to San Antonio as her home. Nye has also written children’s books music and poetry recordings and translations of poetry. For her works she has won many awards including the four Pushcart Prizes, the Jane Addams Children's Book award and the Paterson Poetry Prize. As of today she lives in San Antonio.

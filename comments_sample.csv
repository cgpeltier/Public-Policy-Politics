The distintion is that people, act differently under a veil of anonimity, which is what the monikers are for. If I had known in the beginning of the WP experience, that exchanges among monikers can create hostile environments, I may have not used a moniker (though I did try to use my real name and it was rejected). Another issue, is that defenses I have (there are a few that I don't), are so far in the past, and require due diligence, that I'm sure no one would want to take the time to research them. Also, there have been many exchanges that led to responses, that were being resopnded to, only to have a block or ban already in place, when I went to save the response. The truth of the matter is that I am guilty of poor reactions in the past, but my reactions had some justification to them. Perhaps the one that stands out the most, was when Ramiro Martinez' page, allowed his vanity publication to stand in the article, which helps him sell books, where an audio history I had of McCoy, was not allowed to stand, which would possibly have helped McCoy as well. It was the double standard that caused the spiraling down of the conversation. Again, I believe the moniker scenario should go, as Sanger tried to deny the moniker system before his departure. It would make WP a better environment, without agenda seeking socks and monikers. Just my opinion, and everyone else I talk to. Thanks for the reply. 64.134.6.107"

Snarkiness aside the article clearly delves into why this character of one of the world's most popular shows in considered a gay icon (although a closeted one). Wasn't aware that a wikiproject had to demonstrate active members had contributed to the article although arguably we have as there's not a system for tracking which editor is working a behalf of which project so there's your speculation. As for tagging the article even if there's yet to be any confirmation of Smither's sexuality the tag covers articles of interest to LGBT people's issues not signifying the subject of an article is themselves LGBT.

 Robert Sapolsky and shamanism 

Shouldn't Robert Sapolsky's theory about shamanism and schizotypalism as the source of schizophrenia be mentioned here? He is clearly a notable source on this subject. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WwAQqWUkpI 173.17.92.242  
Before anyone else objects to Youtube as a source, I'll point out that this is Sapolsky giving a lecture. That said, this strikes me as a better fit for Causes of schizophrenia#Evolutionary psychology than here. It's a very speculative theory, albeit from a clearly notable commentator, with little experimental evidence, and it also focuses on what he calls schizotypical personality disorder, and not on schizophrenia per se.

GUESS MY NAME CHALLENGE

 Stop being a power freak 

Hi Plumcouch,

Although you are not an administrator, you seem to be a self-styled Wikipedia policeman.  I don't understand why you have been going around giving people strict instructions on what to write and what not to write.  For the Aamir Khan and Vidya Balan pages, you insist on not having links to fansites.  I don't understand why.  If you want the power of an administrator, become an administrator.  Don't take the law into your own hands.

Administrators are not the law. Admins are normal users with more abilities. See here: []

Fan sites are a big problem. First of all, most of them violate copyright laws by displaying pictures which don't have proper copyright information and strictly, those pages are not allowed to display them. If anther page (like Wikipedia) links them, Wiki can get into trouble and with it the entire project. Also, if you add one fansite, you have to add them all. Wiki is no linkfarm and not there to improve people's traffic. Add content instead of links.

Regarding the Meera Jasmine page, you are exceptionally rigid about what belongs in the page and what does not.  You want a citation for everything, and you claim that a lot of the information is not relevant on the page.  Do you want us to say """"Meera Jasmine is an Indian actress"""", immediately put up a citation, scan a copy of her birth certificate and put it up there just to prove that she exists?

I don't doubt she's an actress. Google has various entries on her to prove that. If someone claims she's a devotee of Ganesha, movie xyz has been a mega-super successful film, it would be nice to add citations so you can identify such claims as not merely fangush or rumour which is very common on actor/actress pages. Lots of actor/actress sites don't have references and I admit that's still a big problem.

In the Filmography, I don't understand why you say the director and the co-star belongs in the movie's entry and not in Meera Jasmine's entry.  I'm sure you understand that the career of every actor or actress is shaped by the number of big names he/she works with, and it is a reflection of the actor's career.  So the info certainly belongs to the Meera Jasmine entry.

""""Big names"""" is a very controversial topic. What's big name? Is a big name still big compared to international directors/actors like Tom Cruise or Steven Spielberg? Furthermore there have been problems with citing co-stars and directors to show that actor xyz is """"greater"""" than actor abc. If you follow the edit history of actors Ajith and Joseph Vijay, you'll find a good example. In order to stop people and fans from these kind of edit wars, I think it's better to keep filmographies as simple as possible - else, things can easily be mistaken as fangush or hero glorification. Also, most actor/actress pages in the Indian Cinema Project have filmographies with just the roles and the movie - it was universally agreed upon and no one of the participants wanted to change that. If you insist upon changing the way articles at the Project should be written, you can make a formal proposal here: .

And why do you insist on creating links to pages that do not exist, such as the movie pages which do not exist?  If you insist on creating a link, you make sure the link points to something, and if a page does not exist, create the page first before pointing to it.

If you have a red link (one without an article behind it), people easily identify it as such and are generally more easily motivated to click on that link and create the article if they have seen the movies. Those red li"

 I'm short of time at the moment, and a lot of the policy and guideline pages have had their content shuffled around, but here is a recent template deletion discussion that illustrates some of the problems with SourceWatch as a reliable source. Beyond issues of bias, the main reason that open wikis are not allowed as reliable sources is that one can never guarantee what is going to appear on the screen at any given random time, when the source page is loaded. It could be good info, or it could be """"POOP"""". That is the main reason that Wikipedia is not allowed to source itself, and the principle holds for all wikis. As to the Drudge issue, I think that the arguments presented on Talk:George Soros in opposition to including well-sourced criticism from Bill O'Reilly apply here, and Eleemosynary was a strong opponent of including that information in the Soros article. The O'Reilly criticism is nowhere near as harsh and derogatory as the piece I removed from Drudge. O'Reilly is certainly more notable (as is his opinion) than the NYPress author. I really would like to see a consistent treatment of sources in all articles, and I try to apply that wherever I edit, but I already have about a thousand articles on my watchlist, so I can't fix everything. -  """

Ok, I added a paragraph about Native Americans and the national park. Chief Joseph's band crossing the park is perhaps the key event, but also notable is that the """"Sheepeater"""" Shoshones had been permanent residents of what became the park until leaving per a treaty (unratified), and that after the Nez Perce crossing of the park and a Bannock band entering the park in 1878, and the Sheepeater Indian War, park superintendent Norris had a fort built to make sure Indians would be prevented from entering the park (the Sheepeater War did not occur in the park but influenced Norris's decision). I'm not sure where this fort was built. These three bits of history seem important enough to include in the park's History section. Unfortunately due to the years when these things took place, the 1870s and 1880s, chronologically they fit into the subsection called """"Park creation""""and seem somewhat out of place among all the info about the early superintendents, rangers, and so on.

It's structurally very hard to get any significant change implemented. If you put a lot of work in you may eventually succeed, but it'll probably take a lot longer than you'd think. One example is the Article Wizard - this took about 2 years from gestation to completing its implementation. And that doesn't really challenge anyone's power, does it? This sort of structural inertia is why I created Wikipedia:Village pump (idea lab), to at least try and have a space where ideas don't get shot down so quickly. Bottom line, the difficulty of changing the governance is not unique - though it's clearly a special case of being even harder. The only solution is to keep trying to come up with new ideas. PS The problem is not so much being given the tools indefinitely; the processes for removal of tools where that's clearly warranted are not so bad. The difficulty is in handling low and mid-level problems, and a certain tendency from people who've heard Wolf cried too many times to dismiss any problems short of """"desysop now"""" seriousness as either bellyaching from troublemakers or just minor stuff of the """"everyone makes mistakes"""" variety.

 UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! 

{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

'In a New Zealand TV2 series presented by Rebecca Gibney called Sensing Murder, which aired on TVNZ beginning in 2006, three psychic mediums from Australia and New Zealand, Sue Nicholson, Kelvin Cruickshank and Deb Webber, armed only with photographs of the victims of unsolved murders, and purportedly no prior knowledge of the cases, attempted to help police detectives and a team of investigators by communicating with the spirits of the victims to uncover details of their life and death. The team of investigators followed up the psychics’ leads and apparently came up with information about the killers and whereabouts of victims' remains.[27] Skepticism regarding the series has come from several sources,[28][29][30] and it was further satirized in the season finale, where host Jeremy Wells humorously highlighted the fact that not a single case had been solved.[31]'

Just how relevant is this? Granted, it does provide criticism, yet it is from a television show. We are given no knowledge of the reputation or fame of these mediums, so it is difficult to criticise all based on a few. If high profile mediums were used, I would have been inclined to agree on the inclusion.

Whilst the rest of the criticism section is valid and comes from scientists etc, the validity of a statement by a television presenter is small, and it is difficult to see any real reason for the inclusion other than to bolster the criticism section.

 Vitamin B12 

Some edits by User:Mrt3366 lack proper references and are factually incorrect.
The claim that """"Bacteria are the only sources of [[vitamin B12|vitamin B12]"""" is false, it is produced by a unicelular alga by example, Pleurochrysis Carterae.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11453796

Fortified breakfast cereals don't offer [[vitamin B12|vitamin B12] from plants, they have it added as a supplement. It is recommended for vegans to take supplements as such, as a minimum dosage can be reliably maintained.

""""The human gut also contains B12-synthesizing bacteria, living from the mouth to the anus"""" looks false. The old 1980 reffered study (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7354869) only reffered to small bowels and it was falsified since.
http://www.beyondveg.com/billings-t/comp-anat/comp-anat-7c.shtml
""""Claims of intestinal B-12 production may be based on insufficient evidence. Albert et al. [1980] is sometimes cited as evidence that B-12 producing bacteria can exist in the small intestine. Sometimes explicit claims are made, e.g., that intestinal bacteria allegedly can produce adequate B-12. Baker [1981] and Nutrition Reviews [1980] are related citations that comment on Albert et al. [1980].
However, a careful reading of Albert et al. [1980] shows that it used bacteriological assays, which are of lower reliability, to measure B-12 levels. Specifically, the most accurate bacteriological assay they used is Ochromonas malhamensis. Note that Ochromonas is the most accurate bacterial assay method for B-12; however, even it may report values for some analogues as part of its """"B-12"""" results [Schneider and Stroinski 1987, Tables 3-2, 5-3 to 5-5, pp. 56-57, 119-123]. Herbert and Das [1994, p. 405] apparently regard all the bacterial assay methods as being less reliable than differential radioassay; also see Herbert et al. [1984] and Herbert [1988] for related information.
Additionally, the data obtained in Albert et al. [1980] comes from isolated bacterial cultures. Therefore, it is unclear whether the bacteria would produce similar amounts of B-12 under the conditions present in the intestines. This point is discussed in Albert et al. [1980], but is sometimes ignored by dietary advocates with an ideological interest in minimizing the requirement for B-12 in the diet. The bottom line in the paper of Albert et al. [1980] is that it shows certain intestinal bacteria might produce B-12, but it is unclear whether/how much might be produced (and absorbed) under actual conditions in the small intestine.""""

The last paragraph contain only straight propaganda from 2 MD personal pages contradicting the necesity of the vitamin, without any reference to reliable sources.

The editor was also part of a dispute on the Vitamin_B12 article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Vitamin_B12#POV_issues  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Algae acquire vitamin B12 through a symbiotic relationship with bacteria.

Individually, algae and bacteria make interesting organisms to study. Bacteria are organisms that can be found living in a range of different environments. Besides being organisms capable of causing disease in humans, they are also vital to the cycling of nutrients within the environment.  Algae are organisms capable of fixing carbon through photosynthesis within aquatic systems.  At the same time they are important to study because with increased nutrient loads to bodies of water can cause algal blooms, which can lead to eutrophication. This reduces the amount of dissolved oxygen available for use by fish and other aquatic organisms.

Bacteria and algae can coexist within biofilms.  Biofilms can help reduce the effects of external factors to produce areas that can allow for growth of specific bacterial populations and make conditions favorable for certain bacterially mediated processes such as denitrification. 

your source however, didn't exactly say that B12 is produced by a unicelular alga. It said   (Talk?)  """

2 treacherous; crafty.
insidiously adv.
insidiousness n.

Perhaps it should be mentioned that the in- morpheme that prefixes the word insidious, is peripheral in meaningfulness, and that the """"sidious"""" element has its root in LAtin insidiae ‘ambush’. So the word ambush should have some relevance in an etymological discussion. - CaptainSurrey"""

The Cosmology part is not by me. I only corrected some really impossibly wrong aspects that someone inserted on a spree of misguided grandiosity. I really have only fixed false stuff, never really written anything but those pieces in the articles we did together. At one point recently (the other day) I nearly eliminated all the Cosmology section and referenced the God Speaks article instead. Then I thought that was too bold, even though that's what my heart says to do. I didn't want to do something that radical without others. But my feeling is that the God Speaks article is much better than the Cosmology section in the Meher Baba article, and that it should only appear in the God Speaks section. So my feeling is still to toss out much of the stuff on the Baba article and if there is anything good or that we missed move it to the God Speaks article. Also, if there is quarelling over these issues in the future, it won't reflect as badly on the main Meher Baba article as it will be a side article. So that's my vote. Sorry I haven't contributed much yet. I find myself pretty shy when it comes to writing. I mostly just try to keep out stuff that is utterly silly.  21:32"

PS As for Grove, do you have another source which has corroborated Grove's statement.  His is the only paper on the Doji bara famine.  The Doji bara famine, moreover, predates any censuses of British India (which began in 1871).  His mortality statistics are based on methods that are conjectural and not rigorous.  Moreover, Grove is an environmental historian, not a historian of colonial India, and consequently, not able to assign political blame.  Is there any reference in the paper to the administration of British India?  Is there any evidence (by way of political culpability) in the paper to back up this one isolated sentence?  Cherry picking isolated sentences in the one and only paper on a topic (involving less than rigorous methods) is WP:UNDUE.  As Jimbo Wales himself says, """"If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it does not belong in Wikipedia regardless of whether it is true or not and regardless of whether you can prove it or not, except perhaps in some ancillary article.""""  In this case, Grove is the only author that has blamed the British, and that too only for not providing relief from the famine, not for causing the famine.

 Interaction Ban... not working 

I'm not waiting 8 hours, sorry. I don't know if that even applies to everyone or just to the editors under the ban, but I don't really care to be honest... this is out of hand. It's absolutely ridiculous what I-P is turning into on Wikipedia and it is largely a result of this interaction ban which is broken on a nearly daily basis. It is pitting the two """"sides"""" against each other and it has gotten worse than I have ever seen it. The interaction ban is not working; therefore, I hope that you will do something else that can help this situation before it completely falls apart. Here are the newest violations of the interaction ban:
I know you are already aware of the post that was made at AN/I. It had a direct mention of Mbz1 by Factomancer through diffs. It was not a complaint about an interaction ban violation on Mbz1's part, so there was no reason for Factomancer to be mentioning Mbz1. You responded at that AN/I and didn't do anything about it, so I guess you didn't consider it a violation for some reason. Maybe because she attempted to strike out and delete the request after the fact? Although personally that makes it worse in my eyes, but clearly I'm not the admin. 
Anyway, past AN/I, she put the same violation on her user page here . It is also a clear violation of WP:UP#POLEMIC. Soon after, she also removed this information, replacing the content with this  stating that she is going on a long break. She has done this before when she has gotten herself into big trouble, only to change her mind after a couple of days and come back. As we can see, her temporary break in that case didn't change her behaviour, as here we are once again.
I'm truly tired of dealing with this crap. Last year we actually had some sort of collaboration going on in I-P on Wikipedia, before we had to deal with issues like this (to this severity, at least). A combination of a few """"new"""" users coming into the I-P struggle relatively recently have turned it into a real warzone between the two sides, and I don't like it. I don't think other people like it either. It is having an EXTREMELY detrimental effect on the encyclopedia in the I-P area, because not only is so much of our time wasted fighting and defending each other in constant AE and AN/I reports, or sitting out short bans for minor infractions, but even aside from that, it just isn't rewarding or feasible to try to contribute and collaborate anymore. There is no longer an expectation that posting something constructive on a talk page will lead to discussion from people who disagree. There is no point of making significant edits to articles because they are simply followed up by quick reverts, often with no edit summary.
I was planning on coming up with some conclusion to this complaint to convince you to take action, but you know what, typically as of late I've even lost my motivation to do that. I just don't care; it's a waste of time and probably won't get the atmosphere between editors back to what it used to be anyway. The problem is that all you can do (or are willing to do anyway) is impose bans based strictly upon the word of the rules interpreted specifically based on the individual situation. If you took a minute to look at the big picture and understand the impact that certain users are having on the entire I-P editing community with their constant infractions and battles, maybe you would think of a different solution.

 News suppressed on Wikipedia http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

RexCurry.net is the historian who made the following discoveries covered elsewhere and on Wikipedia:

1. The USA’s first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis).  It was not an ancient Roman salute.  http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html

2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html

3. The Pledge’s creator was a self-proclaimed socialist in the nationalism movement in the USA and his dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and his Pledge was the origin of their salute. """"Nazi"""" means """"National Socialist German Workers' Party."""" A mnemonic device is the swastika (Hakenkreuz in German).  Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist.""""
http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html

The Pledge is part of the USA’s growing police-state.  The insane government in the U.S. could cause comatose persons to Pledge dis-allegiance, desecrate the flag, and recite a declaration of independence. Remove the Pledge from the flag, remove flags from schools, remove schools from government.

As a libertarian lawyer, Rex Curry provides pro bono services nationwide in schools and elsewhere, to educate the public about the news.

Government schools will never teach children about their Pledge rights, nor the truth about the Pledge and its author.

Most comments fail to ever mention that Francis Bellamy and his cousin Edward Bellamy were National Socialists in the USA, wrote for and supported their """"Nationalist"""" and """"New Nation"""" magazines, the """"Nationalist Educational Association"""" and pushed their totalitarian dogma in their """"Nationalism"""" clubs worldwide, including in Germany, and that the bible of their movement, Edward Bellamy's book """"Looking Backward"""" was translated into every major language including the languages of those countries that became home to totalitarian socialism and the socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part) under the National Socialist German Workers' Party (21 million dead), the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (62 million dead), and the Peoples' Republic of China (35 million dead).  It is easy to see why anyone would want to cover all of that up, but it should not be covered up.

In the USA, the Bellamy dogma supported a government takeover of education.  The government's schools imposed segregation by law and taught racism as official policy.  The USA's behavior was an example for three decades before the Nazis. As under Nazism, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and blacks and the Jewish and others in the USA attended government schools that dictated segregation, taught racism, and persecuted children who refused to perform the straight-arm salute and robotically chant the Pledge. Some kids were expelled from government schools and had to use the many better alternatives.  There were acts of violence. When Jesse Owens competed in the 1936 Olympics in Germany, his neighbors attended segregated government schools where they saluted the flag with the Nazi salute.  The U.S. practice of official racism even outlasted the horrid party.  And the schools and the Pledge still exist. The Pledge is still the most visible sign of the USA's growing police state.  

After segregation in government's schools ended, the Bellamy legacy caused more police-state racism of forced busing that destroyed communities and neighborhoods and deepened hostilities.

Bellamy was a self-proclaimed national socialist in the USA, with the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, and he preached what he called """"military socialism.""""  The federal flag darkens schools because Bellamy wanted government to take over all schools and to eliminate all of the better alternatives.  Worse, Bellamy wanted the government to take over everything, not just schools. He wanted the government to impose the military system on all of society. School flags are a symbol of  nationalization, militarism, and socialism.

The Bellamy dogma was the same dogma that led to the """"Wholecaust"""" (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million killed under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million under the National Socialist German Workers'"

0,""":::Gimme a break Harlan.  I find it incredible that you seem to think these are """"Waldorf"""" goals.  Educating the """"whole child"""" - right - like anyone sets as their goal the education of half a child.  These are, to be sure, Waldorf buzz words - the kind of language Waldorf brochures are filled with - of course.  But they are meaningless in the framework of an encyclopedia article.  They are sensationalism.  They don't deserve mention at all - except in Waldorf brochures - and that's NOT what we are creating here.  And, really, there are lots and lots of examples in which the reality contradicts the """"surrounding the child with moral goodness"""" you are describing.  The easiest to point to is that Waldorf teachers read Grimms fairy tales to the children and promote them to parents to read to their children.  These are the uneditied versions with the """"grimm"""" stuff in them - the types of stories that are filled with immorality and horrible images for young children.  I can recite examples directly from them here but I'm sure everyone knows what I'm talking about - think Hansel and Gretel and all the immorality that goes on in that one.  These are definitely NOT themes of """"moral goodness"""" - they are outrageous themes of depravity.  So again, what we have here is brochure language that, in this case, doesn't even reflect what goes on in Waldorf.  It needs to come out.  Setting up more sections and going into greater detail about each of the """"stated goals"""" is a bunch of hooey as well.  Every school has fantastic goals for their students, just like every parent has wonderful goals for their child.  This article is NOT about the goals of the Waldorf Schools, it is about Waldorf education - what it actually is, what it actually does, what it actually means.  If you want to state goals and ideals, write yourself a brochure - this article is not the place for it.  Sorry.

0,""" North Korea actually gained approximately 230 km² from China in the 1962 treaty. 

And here's a 19th century book by Chong Yagyong, titled """"Korea's Northern Border Reigion"""" (in a Korean sourcebook compilation translated by Peter Hacksoo Lee): 
A long time ago, the area north of the Tumen River was the land of the Su-shen people. It has not been under our control since the time of the Three Han. The ''southern slopes of Mount Changbaek, where both the Tumen and Yalu rivers have their headwaters, lay within our territory, but the winding ridges and layers of peaks make the exact location of the border unclear. However, Emperor K'ang-hsi, in the final years of his reign [1662-1722], ordered Area Commander Wu-la (Wu-la ts'ung-kuan) Muk'eteng to delineate the border and erect a stone boundary marker. As a result, the border between those two rivers is clear as well. [emphasis mine]

Here's another study of the US-North Korea border in 1962, by the US Dept of State, which makes no mention of North Korea owning the entire mountain.  And another, which says that China actually made concessions to NK on the border in 1962 . 

The only sources that seem to claim that Korea once owned the entire place are some recent tabloid news articles that protest China conducting activities on its own side of the border, and of course, a few ultranationalist sites, but please, enlighten me if you can provide other reliable sources as well. 

On another rather amusing note, it does seem my userboxes are being quite effective experiment in showing which users are capable of  judging others by the content their edits, and which prefer to judge a book by it's cover and lash out emotionally.  
should be made in a new section on the talk page. No further edits should be made to this section. The result of the debate was no move.  ' 
Requested move
Chonji → Tianchi – The name was unilaterally moved from Tianchi to Chonji without concensus, for POV reasons (cited in move and talk page), such as that it should be Korean (it's on the border between China and Korea). Another reason cited was that the name of the Baekdu Mountain page is Korean as well. However, a Google search shows nearly 30,000 hits for Tianchi, and and less than 1,000 each for Chonji and Cheonji. That's two orders of magnitude in difference. (the preceding was quoted by Yuje)  
Survey
Add """"* Support"""" or """"* Oppose"""" followed by a brief explanation, then sign your opinion with ~~~~
 Support for the most common name. Searches for """"Chonji"""" for all the most popular search engines combined give less than a thousand hits. Search on Google scholar shows only 2 uses of the name """"Chonji"""" for the lake. The use of Chonji as a clear common name doesn't apply because it's not common. 
 Support — per Yuje.  Naming conventions gives preference to the more popular name. 
Oppose per Visviva and my previous comments. Like I said before, we need to use the most common name that is the clearest because """"Tianchi"""" is a name for many other places in China.  
As shown, Chonji is nowhere near common. Chonji barely shows up any hits, therefore isn't a viable alternative for a clear alternative name.  
Oppose Look at my reason below.  
Comment:  The proposition seems to be flawed...  Given that Tianchi is now an article on the lake in Urumqi, if this article is moved it would need to go somewhere else; perhaps Tianchi (Changbaishan) or even (heh heh) Tianchi (Paektusan), but then again maybe Tianchi (Jilin)... if we must'' have a straw poll, it would be helpful to know what the full suggested title is.    Comment''': The issue you brought up is a legitimate one and shouldn't be ignored. Thus perhaps Tianchi could be a disambiguation page, or this page could be moved back to the original and there could be a Tianchi (disambiguation) page. Either one is a reasonable alterna"

 I  define ignosticism as the notion that as His attributes are incoherent and contradict each other, He is meaningless, conrary to my friend David Ramsay Steele who finds Him understandable. What I mean is that whilst one can fathom the  definitions of His attributes and Him, their incoherence really means that He means nothing.
 David states that had scientists resorted to verification, they'd have overlooked atoms and now- superstrngs,  but right before that he states in principle. Indeed, those two matters in principle were knowable whilst God defends on theologian's it must be's and guesses [ John Hick really guesses in dealing with the problem of evil1]. 
 I find as arguments for Him beg the question, such notions as First Cause are meaningless such that theistic arguments themselves affirm ignosticism or in this case, kake it igtheism.

0,""":The PC 1 gradation could or not show Neolithic influence. I have already provided links that strongly suggest that it is very unlikely. Part of it could be Neolithic and part of it could be much more ancient. If it were Neolithic, it would have its lowest gradient in Atlantic Europe, where Neolithic was weakest and most tardy, yet it doesn't. PC 4 instead does. Whatever RR says, it's not so clear how to read some of these PCs, all but PC 3 (likely IE) and PC 5 (clearly Basque) rise more questions than give clear answers. 
Neolithic genetic influence doesn't need to be not European in origin. European Neolithic started in Thessaly and the alleged links with West Asia (particularly beyond Turkey) are rather unclear. So PC 1 could perfectly be part of the Paleolithic European inheritance, maybe reinforced with new Neolithic input too. 
PC 4 is weakest precisely in the less """"Neolithized"""" areas of Europe: Britain, Britany and Basque Country. Greeks definitively did never colonize anything outside the Mediterranean shores, so the explanation of RR is very weak. It may not say who's """"more European"""" (Balcanic peoples are clearly European however you look at it) but it may say who's more neatly Western European genealogically. It is very concordant with Y-DNA, btw. 
PC 3 (Indoeuropean probably) also shows a gradient and this shows who is more Western European too (in this case Basques and Iberians). This pattern is curiously inverted by PC 5. 
PC 1 and PC 2 instead show less clear patterns, what surely implies they are older and have hitchhiked other migrations if anything. They do show some correlation with SW Asia and NW Asia respectvely and they make up the 50% of European genetic pool (while the other three together only add up to 23%). 
PC 2 patterns show as much Asian influence as PC 1 and they can well be seen as a complementary, one centered in NW Asia and the other in SW Asia, both decreasing towards the west, the same that happens with PC 3 and PC 4. All 4 show historical Asian or Eastern European influence """"against"""" a nearly invisible Western core, best represented (maybe) among Basques. The pattern is pretty clear, the explanations maybe not so much. 
On the other hand the """"Basque"""" PC 5 is still strong in Eastern Europe but weakest in a central strip from Balcans to Scandinavia. 
So you tell me: which of these 5 components is more distinctly European if any? The more I think about it the more confuse it seems...
Why do you defend one tentative explanation of European genealogies over others? Do you have good reasons? Studies maybe? 
The only thing we know for sure is that all European lineages of all sorts, autosomal or halpoid, have links to West Asia. The weakest ones those that are +/- exclusive of Basque and Atlantic Europeans possibly. 
All European components are strong in West Asia. You want to make a one sided view of what is European but what those maps show if anything is that there are at least five sides and all are strongly present in Western Asia. 
Now it's your turn: show me what makes Europeans so distinct. You owe me that explanation and proof since long ago.
You have been obstructing this article from a viewpoint that you still are unable to prove beyond a most questionable dictionary quote. Give evidence or yield to reason.

Pity that it is, (it was really hard to find a reliable source to prove this) because it would great to add to the page, however it's no longer accurent. For now, I will just display the information on here for those to view. According to the book Chris was 20 yrs. old when his parents passed and Claire was 15 yrs. old (1993) when their parents died. Here's a second source of information from the book that a forum had featured on their site, http://bbs.chinabroadcast.cn/read.php?tid=109739] which also confirms Chris' and Claire's parents' deaths. The book talks about events that happened before Resident Evil 1. (Original):

""""Chapter One: Resident Evil 

Chris: Whenever the phone rings in the middle of the night. I know someone's dead who wasn't dead the day before. Happens all the time. Except when it's a wrong number. Like this totally drunk woman who thought I was her long lost lover. Or the idiot who tied up my line with a long monologue in Portuguese. 

I've had this late-night fear of the phone for five years now, ever since a state police chaplain called me at two a.m. to tell me my parents were dead. Their vacation van had been crushed by a runaway big rig. The coroner had to ID them through dental records, they were mangled so bad.""""  """

Theoretically, polygamy can assume any one of three possible forms: polygyny or the marriage of one man to two or more wives at a time, polyandry or the coexistent union of one woman with two or more men, and group marriage or a marital union embracing at once several men and several women.  Of these, only the first is common.

And on page 25 

A statistical analysis of Kaingang genealogies for a period of 100 years showed that 8 per cent of all recorded unions were group marriages, as compared with 14 per cent for polyandrous, 18 per cent for polygynous, and 60 per cent for monogamous unions.

The disadvantage of working at a medical school is that the anthropology texts are not extensive, but they aren't checked out often either. This had been sitting on the shelf for over 20 years, deep in the recesses of the basement. Murdock is a sufficient reference for polygamy including group marriage."

Northern Ireland (, Ulster Scots: Norlin Airlann) is a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland[2]...

2 In common with the other constituent parts of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland is sometimes referred to as a """"country"""" (example). The UK government also refers specifically to Northern Ireland as being a """"province"""" (UK: example; NI: example) or a """"region"""" (UK: example; NI: example). Regardless of the choice of term, it is likely to be unsatisfactory and can imply a preferred political perspective:
 """"One problem must be adverted to in writing about Northern Ireland. This is the question of what name to give to the various geographical entities. These names can be controversial, with the choice often revealing one's political preferences. ... some refer to Northern Ireland as a 'province'. That usage can arouse irritation particularly among nationalists, who claim the title 'province' should be properly reserved to the four historic provinces of Ireland-Ulster, Leinster, Munster, and Connacht. If I want to a label to apply to Northern Ireland I shall call it a 'region'. Unionists should find that title as acceptable as 'province': Northern Ireland appears as a region in the regional statistics of the United Kingdom published by the British government."""" - J. Whyte and G. FitzGerald, 1991, Interpreting Northern Ireland, Oxford University Press: Oxford
 """"One specific problem - in both general and particular senses - is to know what to call Northern Ireland itself: in the general sense, it is not a country, or a province, or a state - although some refer to it contemptuously as a statelet: the least controversial word appears to be jurisdiction, but this might change."""" - S. Dunn and H. Dawson, 2000, An Alphabetical Listing of Word, Name and Place in Northern Ireland and the Living Language of Conflict, Edwin Mellen Press: Lampeter
 """"Next - what noun is appropriate to Northern Ireland? 'Province' won't do since one-third of the province is on the wrong side of the border. 'State' implies more self-determination than Northern Ireland has ever had and 'country' or 'nation' are blatantly absurd. 'Colony' has overtones that would be resented by both communities and 'statelet' sounds too patronizing, though outsiders might consider it more precise than anything else; so one is left with the unsatisfactory word 'region'."""" - D. Murphy, 1979, A Place Apart, Penguin Books: London and it is situated in the north-east of the island of Ireland. It shares a border with the Republic of Ireland to the south and west. At the time of the 2001 UK Census, its population was 1,685,000, constituting between a quarter and a third of the island's total population and about 3% of the population of the United Kingdom.


Snowded, what is it that you find incorrect about this? The phrasing used is verbatium copy of how Northern Ireland is described on that 10 Downing Street webpage you keep wheeling out:""""Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom...""""
Your approach is based on a cherry picking of sources. The copy you oppose is neutral, source-based and explains the issue clearly, factually and fairly. If there are specific issues with it then critique it. Don't just say, """"I don't like it"""". rannṗáirtí anaiṫnid (coṁrá)

There should not be non-Christians on a list of converts to Christianity. That is the issue. This is not a voting process. This is a talking process.

Why are any of us trying to expand it to include more? The concept of this list is the listing, not of those who have experimented with Christianity, but of those who have found Christianity. Did Dylan (and the two others) find Christianity, or is it more correct to say that they experimented with Christianity? It almost seems as though one is penalized for experimentation. Should a Jew be cautious in checking out Christianity? That is the lesson that we gain from the goings on here. Dylan is not a convert to Christianity. Please compile a list of converts to Christianity. Don't include on it those who are Jews, or those who are of any other religion. Please include on it only Christians.

Wikipedia (it's editors and administrators) uses double standards and does not follow their own written polices as they have wrongly and recklessly deleted the following addition to Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl wikipedia article. 

 Independent film maker Royce Mathew had sued the Walt Disney Company, Jerry Bruckheimer Inc./films, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio in Federal Court in regards to the Pirates of the Caribbean movie.  Detailed in the lawsuits www.disneylawsuit.com  filed in Federal court “PUBLIC RECORD” (2005 & 2006), and in various national and international news and press releases, state that in the early 1990's independent film maker Royce Mathew had pitched his original supernatural pirate story to the Walt Disney Company which is about “cursed pirates” of the Black Pearl pirate ship; pirates who don't want anything to do with the plunder/return a treasure because they are cursed, with effects of the curse they endure is fully revealed by moonlight and the gold medallion on a gold chain with mystic properties able to summon/call.  Royce Mathew had made a short derivative video work in 1994.  Royce Mathew’s credits included projects for Paramount Pictures, Allan Carr, David DeCoteau and Charles Band and his Full Moon Entertainment company.

Then years later, as the lawsuit details, via Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, the Walt Disney Company, had incorporated various homages from their Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride attraction into Royce Mathew’s supernatural pirate story, and are selling it as Walt Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl movie franchise.   The Walt Disney Company states that Royce Mathew’s claims and lawsuits have no merit.  

During legal proceedings,  the Walt Disney Company, Jerry Bruckheimer (films/Inc.), Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio “The Defendants” were all represented by the same team of attorneys headed by Sanford “Sandy” Litvack, who is a close associate of the Walt Disney Company (Michael Eisner), who also was the Walt Disney Company’s attorney in the noted lawsuit of Jeffrey Katzenberg vs the Walt Disney Company."

Whatever, no one need take my word for anything. I know the topics fairly thoroughly, through primary and secondary sources in Japanese and Western languages. I try however to avoid the topic area because of the need to WP:AGF, and all I can see is puerile bickering and dumb-ignorant edits based on an inability to see good sources and evaluate reliable evidence. I see only POV passions, googling for evidence to support them, and above, all, the tolerance on the page of sheer bad edits or nonsense that anyone with the slightest BA competence in Japanese studies would find laughable (I'm thinking of CurtisNaito in this regard). There are massive corrections to be made, but, as Ubikwit says, one simply doesn't have the time (at least for now), except to note that the litigants who do edit those pages, can't see the obvious (citing outdated sources like Fenellosa et al. from a century back,etc. I gave details a year ago why none of them are reliable, and suggested how to fix the sourcing: almost nothing done, and my edits are invariably to replace bad edits by giving several good sources, which, however anyone could do, if they had the foggiest idea of what Japanese scholarship knows). If there is competent area specialists available to review these messes, by all means get a third opinion from her, them. Nishidani (talk)

0,""" Bad crap ==

What bunch of crazies wanted connection to the Force to be mystical instead of genetic? Movies like these shouldn't be mystical! It's about the happenings in a fictional galaxy, not some weird spiritual garbage! The only time it should be spiritual is if it were referencing Christianity, and referencing it correctly at that!  01:48, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I, for one, am an atheist and don't believe in all that spiritual crap myself. However, I think that mysticism in stories makes them much, well… better. It also enhances the theme.   02:24, Jun 9, 2005 (UTC)

How does it do that?  15:26, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Scorpionman, what makes you think that a movie should only be spiritual if it references Christianity and not another religion? —  দ 07:34, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I suppose that depends on your point of view. I'm not relativistic, but when it comes to things like science fiction, there's no need for spiritual stuff.  15:26, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

In fact, I was disappointed when I learned that the Jedi use some mystical substance that can't be measured scientifically. It would make more sense for me if they were just highly-trained concentrated people. -  14:21, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

The Jedi don't really use the midi-clorians. The midi-clorians just connect them to the Force, and the Force is what the Jedi use.   23:04, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)
By """"some mystical substance that can't be measured scientifically"""" I mean the Force. I'm quite disappointed by its very existence in Star Wars. -  06:46, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I don't really think it needs to reference ANY religion. Science fiction is science fiction! If you think it needs to reference Islam, that's your opinion.  03:30, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I don't think he ever mentioned Islam.   00:14, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC)

I am not sure to whom the anonymous editor was referring (I don't see any reference to Islam either), and I suppose this discussion isn't really relevant here anyway. But for the record, I have no problem with spirituality without reference to a specific or already-existing religion, especially in something like Star Wars where the connection of the """"humans"""" to us is obscure (since it takes place during ancient times in a distant galaxy). I was responding to Scorpionman's odd (in my opinion) comment that movies should only be spiritual if they reference Christianity instead of other religions. I personally think it's better to stay away from specific religions. —  দ 02:00, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I really would rather have it not reference spirituality, but my """"weird comment"""" stating that it should only reference Christianity is my point of view. I know not everybody agrees, but I really would rather it all be purely technological and scientific.  01:55, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

The Force is a power that can not easily be conceived, my young padawan. We must learn to harness its energies, let it flow through us. Only then can we become one with the Force.   02:13, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC)

Where are Star Wars Episodes IV and V and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, both are much better films than E.T.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 75.68.124.228   

Which had the biggest budget?  Which spent the most on advertising?  Which generated the most box office receipts?  Of course, all of these variables are interrelated, and there is no practical way of isolating one variable without compromising the others.   If we ignored technological differences, Robinson Crusoe on Mars, Fantastic Planet, Forbidden Planet, The Time Machine (1960 film), and When Worlds Collide are all up in the running.     

King Kong?
Why was King Kong remove on the list? It had a sorce and everything! 71.178.250.89  
I removed it because it did not have a citation specifically mentioning it as being """"the best"""" of the genre.  Being one of 100 films on Time's list is only a citation for being """"one of the the 100 best films according to Time"""", nothing more.  It seems unreasonable to imply that because there is only one film of a particular genre on a """"best film"""" list, the mention equals a citation for being the best of the genre.  That would be original research because the film may have been selected for reasons that have nothing to do with being the best of the genre.  ☑ uelWantman 

Request to delete this page.
While I don't disagree with the fact that you can at least narrow down several films which many consider great, this page is misleading. What purpose does it serve? The movies it lists are extremely inconsistent, and this page changes all the time. People will like what they like, and I think it is unfair that wikipedia, a generally factual resource, includes such a subjective topic as this and other polls. I also think that we should delete links to reviews for films and music. What other refutable encyclopedia does this? You cannot systematically grade personal taste.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 66.159.181.59   

The point of the page is to list those films that have been previously recognized by a variety of critics and organization.  The opinions of these films are not of Wikipedia users, but of a variety of organizations.   

Regardless of the notoriety of the sources, they don't constitute an article.  The citations are to sources of opinion which should, in my opinion, be added to the articles of their respective films. 'Talktome 

I believe that the page should be deleted, Its very opinionated (yes i know its all sourced from other people) but still who has the deciding line on what the greatest film, there are many variants. This sort of page is suited to someones' blog, not a Wikipedia article. Its a fine line to what should be on Wikipedia but this i think should be deleted.   

Although this page somewhat irks me, I believe it would most likely make it through a deletion proposal with a Keep decision.  The article is technically 100% factual in that it is stating, """"so and so thinks this movie is the greatest.""""  Personally, I think that this sort of information on critic and audience opinions should be reserved for the individual entries for the films, and that an attempt to build a list such as this is inherently flawed.  Specifically, my problem is that the personal opinions of Wikipedians are bound to show up in this article in that, in many cases, I believe that with enough searching you could find somebody's'' list that has your favorite movie on top.  Of course, the failsafe against this is that editors must decide whether or not that """"somebody"""" is a notable c"

There are good reasons to claim that the catastrophical event of the atomic bombing of Japan, marks the shift to what we here term contemporary in regard of art as defined in the contents page per 27 October 2010, or 19 Dhu al-Qidah 1431, or 19 Heshavan 5771. Butoh may thus be regarded as the epitome of contemporary art. Except from this, it is a problematic definition for a number of reasons. First. Art by artists working both before the World War II, during and after, can not necessarily be defined as more, or less, contemporary because of this timestamp. Contemporary art did explicitly exist also before World War II, as this label - contemporary - has been expressed as a mark of quality, pertaining especially to modernism, by art carrying an ideal summoning, from the artist or his genius, making some kind of composed expression of what, in such case, are to be evaluated or considered the spirit of the time, reflecting or in dialogue with the contemporary world, in the event of the art-making process including its publication or presentation. Another trickster is, for me, that the concept of contemporaneousness also must be regarded in relation to art that specifically deals with contemporarity as it moved through time. It is absurd as a Norwegian to not consider Henrik Ibsen a maker of contemporary art. His plays are distinguished by being contemporary plays and historic plays. I sincerly believe that Henrik Ibsen was intending to make drama that also were to be transformed, or may I say be transported by the unfolding of time. The retrospective style of his contemporary plays is at least a strong indication for that his plays not necessarily should stay in the conformity of the 19th century. I think it is possible to find many other reasons for striking out such a definition of contemporary art as this lexicalisation implies."
0,"Inconsistency
some names in the list are prefixed with the  Sayyed title; others are not. I think the list should be consistent in that regard with the correct title for all. One way is to add a prefix column before the name to indicate Sayyed vs Sheikh. Either a small font or an abbreviation (Syd/Shk) should work.

First off, Doright seems to consistently ignore the request to propose and gain consensus for edits to the introduction that have been made throughout this page. Notice that near the top of the page, I proposed removing the seccond paragraph from the introduction altogether, since its emphasis on the recentism of Palestinian identity seems WP:UNDUE. Despite some agreement from other editors, I have not proceeded with that move, in order to gain full consensus first. When Doright comes along and ignores that discussion and others on this page stressing the importance of gaining consensus to changes to the introduction before editing so as to avoid edit-warring, it's disrespectful to others who are patiently waiting to gain consensus first. It also increases the tendency towards edit-warring, so please stop it. Besides that, regarding the content added, all Doright has done is further emphasize the """"recentism"""" by repeating the information at the end of the second paragraph and the beginning of that paragraph. This completely ignores the views of other editors regarding the WP:UNDUE emphasis of having this paragraph in the introduction, increases the WP:UNDUE emphasis further, and is redundant. Please propose your changes to the introduction here first, discuss, and gain consensus before making such similar changes again. Thanks. talk

Also according to wikipedia it was increased borrowing, not increased spending, that lead to Reagan deficits: as a short-run strategy to reduce inflation and lower nominal interest rates, the U.S. borrowed both domestically and abroad to cover the Federal budget deficits, raising the national debt from $997 billion to $2.85 trillion. This led to the U.S. moving from the world's largest international creditor to the world's largest debtor nation. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaganomics

Is he really the senior male-line dynastic descendant of Victoria & Albert? Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester is the most senior male-line male descendant of Victoria & Albert as he is the surviving son of Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester and, as the Duke's two elder brothers, Edward and Albert (who reigned as George VI) had no sons, is since the death of his elder brother, William in 1972, the senior male-line male grandchild of George V, who was the surviving son of Edward VII, the first son of Victoria & Albert. Prince Andreas is a descendant of Leopold, Duke of Albany, who was Victoria and Albert's fourth son and Edward VII's youngest brother. Thus, he can't be considered as the senior male-line descendant of Victoria and Albert but, through dynastic changes in succession with renounciation of rights to the throne of Coburg by the future Edward VII and the Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, he is the current titular Duke and thus is, with no doubt, the head of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Nonethelles, his British cousins from the Windsor family are agnatically senior to his family. We can say that Prince Andreas is the senior male-line descendant of Prince Albert in right of the former realm of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, as the elder lines of his descendants (thourgh Edward VII and Arthur, Duke of Connaught, now extinct in male-line) renounced their rights to it, but definitely he is not Prince Albert's senior male-line descendant in general."

Yes, notions of linguistic relativity have been important in some sectors of speculative fiction, just as notions of faster-that-light travel have been in others. That does not mean that fiction plays a comparably important role in the philosophy of language nor in physics. As Maunus says, this article is, and ought to be, about the linguistic and philosophical treatment of various notions of linguistic relativity, not about their uptake in fiction, among creators of constructed languages, or in other creative applications.

A history of scholarship on language and thought may or may not be useful. I wonder (a) if it would serve as the sort of basic encyclopedic need of this project, or might it be better suited to some sister project such as Wikiversity or Wikibooks; and (b) whether such a history would be possible without original research via synthesis.

 WP:AFC on Marathonios 

Note: The following post by an IP about Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Tiberius Claudius Hipparchus Marathonios has been copied here from User talk:EdJohnston/Anontalk.   

Thank you for taking the time to review my proposed article! As the source of the wealth of Herodes Atticus probably was his grandfather, i thought some sentences could exist for him, having also an interesting story. His name is (or almost is) as set in my article, through many sources (of which a mentioned in the article only one):
http://www.geni.com/people/Tiberius-Claudius-Hipparchus-de-Marathon/6000000013238402549
http://www.muldermedia.com/roots/INDIs/II2429.html

Marathonios shows descent from Marathon, a famous town of Attica. It was usual at the time to always add the town to which one was belonging. So, most of the times one was using only his first name, but among faraway people the town was used as well (Thales of Miletus or Miletios etc). Whether Wikipedia's policy is to use the full name or just the first i cannot tell and i would appreciate your advice.
But.. in this article http://mapyourinfo.com/wiki/en.wikipedia.org/Herodes%20Atticus/ (see Ancestry) Wikipedia already uses that exact name!  
Probably the right spelling might have been Marathonius, as all the name in in latin, but mostly is mentioned as Marathonios, so i would vote this way.
— Preceding unsigned comment added by 79.129.49.66   

Thanks for your note. If you create future AFC nominations, the record-keeping is easier if you will create an account, instead of using a variety of IP addresses. My original AFC comment was based on the linked sources not supporting your submission. It appeared to me that bits of information about different ancient figures were being mixed up together. This runs of the risk of an article misinforming our readers. In your above post, geni.com etc are not considered to be WP:Reliable sources for Wikipedia. The Google Book is OK but it only confirms that Herod Atticus's grandfather was known as Tiberius Claudius Hipparchus, without the word 'Marathonios'. So your information has no reliable source. Herod Atticus may have had a relative known as 'Marathonios', but that seems to be a different person who was born after the death of Hipparchus.    """

Then it can be agreed that the citation is verified. Otherwise I am going to clean up Rashtrakuta, Vijayanagara and whatever else where the book is cited. 

Secondly, if you are """"trashing"""" Tarun Bharat, and you are saying Frontline isn't neutral 'cause it's from Tamil Nadu, then what about Deccan Herald. I ask admins to remove all citations from Deccan Herald and Kannada newspapers. BTW, I have the subscription of India Today and I am gonna start an article on Kannada which is very well detailed in the last issue of India Today as well as many Marathi and English newspapers and books. So don't worry. We'll start an article for Kannada. Now you must be happy. 

I will start my work tomorrow.

The inclusion of 'high-accuracy' was a reluctant compromise, following the suggestion by Paine for 'fair-accuracy'. My approach is to remove calculus entirely from mention, given that there is no supporting evidence that it does anything remotely close to solving the paradoxes  when considering the infinite orders of magnitudes below the Planck length, that calculus spans, but which cannot be proved via experimental evidence as being at all relevant.

Wikipedia does need to make a review of its policies and role it wants to serve as a web 2.0 encyclopedia. Here was something I said in the talk page of the 'a more perfect union'.

(I believe that most of time the argument is about this main issue of 'Is Wikipedia is being used for publicity?' and NOT an argument about whether it is just an 'Encyclopedia of important events or topics occuring or occured'. I am sure once the presidential race is over, there would be no such argument of the deletion of this article whatsoever, and people discussing about this speech would be doing so solely because of its content, its linguistic delivery, and other reasons solely for historical and educational reasons. Most of the times people are forgotten but what they have done or said makes them remembered. Today there are 350 million google hits for the 'I Have a Dream' speech [3] and 20 million for 'Martin Luther King' [4] but only 2.3 million hits for 'I Have a Dream Martin Luther King' search, [5], suggesting that many people especially in non-American countries perhaps would know the speech but not even knowing who said it in the first place. By contrast there are only 1 million hits for 'A More Perfect Union Barack Obama' [6] 722 thousand hits for 'Barack Obama Speech on Race' [7], but 30 million hits for 'Barack Obama' [8]. My argument is that I implore Wikipedia users to please let go of this dilemna and constant debate of trying to keep Wikipedia non publicity and solely information, because by deleting articles some Wikipedia editors find is adding publicty to one person named Barack Obama, they are also deleting something which is so much potentially informational for many other billions of people who just want information on this particular speech. I say let the people decide how they filter their information, because the election only objectively affects 300 million Americans [9], but the race-issue affects everybody on the planet, and this speech IS a key speech on that matter.Msethisuwan (talk) )"

 Article needs overhaul 
 This pages need serious considerations of revisal.  

An ethnic group means sharing a large element of genetic relation amongst its members. Afghans (Tajiks included) are closer related to Northwest South Asian populations GENETICALLY, than to Iranian populations. 

http://www.zackvision.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/genome_Zack_Full.txt.cleaned_BGA_4.png

Iranians, on the other hand, genetically cluster with South Caucasians, Anatolians, and Mesopotamians. The only relation Tajiks have with Persian Iranians is a shared language and somewhat-shared literary culture. Other than that, the genetics prove that they are not closely related groups.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

 This pages need serious considerations of revisal.  

i agree, this article need serious consideration as soon as possible for revisal

the article is totally misleading. tajiks and afghans should have their own article and like other nations, persians (or iranians) should have an article of their own. perisan is only an ancient name for iranians. please consider correcting the article.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Exactly, this really is extremely misleading. There already is a """"Persian language"""" page- the ethnicities are distinct.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

 request of an administrator  

Please revert this article, this article is full of errors. iranians and afghans are two different nationalities and ethnicities. they can not be mixed according to wikipedia rules and according to the fact that persian (iranians) and afghans are not the same thing and can not be in the same category. thank you  

 Second Paragraph Should Be Deleted 

""""Afghanis, better known as Afghoonis or Efis and Afaghaneh, are not part of the Persian people and they are acting as wannabe persians, they are not proud of their nation and we Iranians hate them hate them hate them.""""

This should be taken out of the article, for obvious reasons/
  

 afghoonis are not Persians 

afghanis are not persians, austrians speak german but are not germans and they do not consider themselves as germans, they are neither considered germans by the people of germany, the people of switzerland speak french but they are only swiss and it is wrong to call the swiss peoiple as french people. the people of belgium speak dutch, but they are not dutch or netherlanders, the people of brazil speak portuguese but they are not portuguese people. they are brazilians speaking portuguese. the people of ghana speak english but they are not english. and finally the afghans speak a dialect of persian. but they are not persians racially or ethnically or historically. afghans are ethnically and racially a mixed nation. the tajiks, are related to people of central asia, to the people of uzbekistan, turkmenistan and tajikistan. the tajiks of afghanistan look exactly the same as tajik and uzbeks because they are the same. the hazaras are not related to the iranian or persian race, they are of mongol origin, their hazaragi language which is a dialect of dari language, is heavily mixed with the momgolian languiage, their look and appearence attest to the fact that they are only assimilated mongols. even the word hazara is a millitary unit which describe that they were a part of  the mongol chengiz khan army who destroyed civilization of iran including nishabur and tus and many other cities of khorasan. (khorasan is in iran and is iranian, not afghani or afghanistan). 

tajiks are iranized or persianized central asians, like uzbeks are turkified central asian people. tajik is NOT a synonym of persian or iranian, tajik only refered to people of central asia which became iranized,"

 Wikinews Australia Day

 Archived clarification 

 Perhaps I am missing something and you have been requested to archive this; however, as we are still in the middle of voting on motions here, could you please reinstate this?  Thanks.    
Once a motion reaches the majority (or in this case, the majority plus a couple), and has been that way for 24 hours, it is considered passed. Is there any special circumstance which allows you to request the passing of this motion to be delayed?   
The motions passed at 01:51 on today's date, which is less than 24 hours. As well, additional clarifications were made in the last 24 hours. I wouldn't call them """"special"""" circumstances, I expect them to remain on the page for at least the 24 hours after the motion passes so that the involved parties can read them.    
Oh, so you'd like me to restore them for three hours then, despite the fact that they are going to read them when I deliver the talk page notifications anyways? Go right ahead. Done. Please also note that in future, given this little piece of silliness by the Committee, everything is going to be archived right on time, and if any member of the Committee objects they need to show me a majority of the Committee supporting their viewpoint before they can do anything about it. It's this kind of ridiculousness—I'm going out in two hours and hence, given the votes over and beyond the majority, it has never been a problem to archive something 3 hours early with such strong support for the motions—that pisses me off about the Committee. We follow the Arbitration Committee procedures, and hence your observation that we need to be """"requested to archive this"""" in your initial comment is a patently incorrect line of thinking.
Ridiculous...   
To be more precise, the first motion passed with Newyorkbrad's abstention at 02:22 UTC, and there were two clarifying comments made to that motion following his vote, in part to address his concerns. You're certainly encouraged to have a life outside of Wikipedia; it's one of the reasons why we have a group of clerks instead of just one. If it's not convenient for you to take an action, I am sure that another member of the team will be happy to do so.    

Hi Daniel, sorry to toss another piece of bureaucracy at you, but since technically this was a clarification of the Martinphi-ScienceApologist case, shouldn't it be posted on that case's talkpage? onka

Yes it was sourced to a blog, but I think it was reliable.  It has been published on the blog for a year and it is sourced to a court transcript. The pro se litigant was a Yale grad. The blog owner is a 3rd year law student and I don't think he would misquote a federal judge.  Isn't there a way to use that source, with whatever notations?

My statements of views are merely responding to yours.  You write """"I did write that the CA rule creates a double standard, because it does. It says one set of rules governs how the court must act when all parties are represented by counsel, and another set applies to pro se litigants."""".  I don't think that is true. What rule are your referring to?  To the best of my knowledge all the written rules are exactly the same in all courts for both pro ses and attorney except for 1.) ECF, which pro ses are frequently not allowed to use, 2.) pro se forms, which  pro ses aren't required to use.  An attorney could probably use the pro se forms if they wanted. 3.) appellate appendixes  in pro se cases the entire case file is sent over and there is no provision for joint appendixes, a disadvantage for pro ses.  There are also other procedures for pro ses, which are not in the rulessee the appellate procedures which I quoted from the case manuals. As I read the California manual, it seemed merely to instruct the judges to provide more explanation.  I don't remember reading anything that seemed to indicate that a pro se paper would be processed but the same paper from an attorney would be dismissed.

Criminal legislation is supposed to be clear.  A crime is supposed to be a crime no matter who does it unless they are mentally ill or a child.

If someone is jailed for disrupting a court, the Federal Rules require that the court say what the disruption consists of, so there should not be a question of what it was.

Please give me an example of a court order that you think a person can be jailed for not obeying, other than not paying alimony or child support, or not testifying when subpoened about a crime or not responding to a subpoena by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.   """

 Saath Nibhaana Saathiya 

Hi again. I understand your willingness to help clean-up the (perhaps) poorly maintained articles of Indian television shows. I myself have contributed towards helping make the Saath Nibhaana Saathiya article somewhat more readable, although I haven't yet begun the momentous task of cleaning up the """"Plot"""" section, which would involve either watching several episodes or collating sources for episode descriptions. It is something that I will try to help clean-up shortly.

However, I have rearranged the cast table once more. My reasoning for this is that the actors names have never been promoted by the channel. They have always been referred to as their characters. Visit the Star Plus website (only the characters are mentioned)... look at the opening credits (only the production team is referred to)... and look at the promotional programming such as the Star Parivaar Awards (the actors names are never mentioned, and they accept awards dressed as their characters). This does imply that the name of the character looms larger in the public consciousness than the name of the actor, no matter how frustrating it may be from an encyclopedic point-of-view. Therefore, the character name is the most relevant to readers/visitors of Wikipedia, and it is these names that should be credited first, not the actors.

You seem to be arguing that wikipedia should categorize this article as """"mythology"""", because your source is that Encyclopedia Britannica categorizes """"Leviathan"""" as mythology.  The multiple logical fallacies here should be apparent.  Getting back on topic, there are numerous religious organizations with hundreds of millions of followers that teach the Tower of Babel was a historical event, and you are also arguing that their point of view should not be respected, beause apparently you think you have found some kind of superior knowledge to them to be able to state that it was not a historical event.   But wikipedia should be neutral, and should not use such biased and non-neutral language to take sides and declare any one scripture to be """"mythology"""", your own pov notwithstanding.  It must not take any stand whatsoever on whether it is historical or mythological, but should just present all the evidence and let readers make up their own mind instead of trying to make it up for them.

 Yet my last sentence in my foregoing post is perfectly veridical. Even now Jeffro77 (and you) are unaware of the illiterate nature of his edit even though I reproduced it for him (from the """"Existence of God"""" Talk page): """"The Deutsch citation is entirely correct, and the quoted text is available at the linked article in the citation. Failing to use the exact citation supplied by you is immaterial."""" But as anyone who is literate can see, his citation is incorrect: """"Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here"""".

 """"Chapter 14"""" of what book? By whom?

 Nor did I ever call anyone at Wikipedia a bully. That's a false claim by you. You therein protest too much (cf. Hamlet, Act III, Scene II, line 240).

 As well, I don't merely make charges, I prove what I state. Jeffro77 and Ilkali both repeatedly made false claims regarding the subject for which there is no excuse due to the information being readily at hand within either the subsection under question itself or in the hyperlinked Wikipedia articles. Neither of them knew the slightest thing about the Omega Point Theory other than that they knew that its author maintains that it physically proves God's existence, which was all it took to rile them up. While lacking knowledge about a subject is not itself an error, what is completely uncalled for is to have vociferous opinions on an issue while remaining in that state of ignorance.

 That's the current state of this matter. Those who have repeatedly shown a willingness to make factually false statements on the matter, and whose ignorance regarding the subject is nearly complete, now have their illiterate and clownishly censorial, and indeed illogical, edit showing.

 Regarding the illogic of the edit, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he deleted mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.

 So by Jeffro77's own words, he must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted mention of this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.

 Jeffro77's edit is so ridiculously biased and illogical that it's a sick joke.74.4.222.208  """

Dealing with misuse of process

""""Unlike trolls who vandalize articles, the majority of the damage caused by those misusing process is indirect. Generally it is best to simply state your opposition and leave it at that. 

In many cases someone else has already gone through an explanation, and you can simply say you agree. If a nomination or listing is obviously going to fail, """"piling on"""" explanation after explanation or personally attacking the nominator is not going to change anything; the listing or nomination will fail anyway. 

If the number of listings starts getting excessive (even if they are on separate pages) then you might want to use the dispute resolution process. Dispute resolution does take a while, though. If the number of nominations/listing is very high the most damage will be done if there is no emergency block put in place. In general, let the process run. """"

0,"Hmm... Not really sure what all you are asking. Geomorphology is the study of landforms. Structural geology is the study of structures (folds, faults, etc) within the rocks at scales varying from microscopic to continental. Now of course they are interrelated. Essentially, landforms are the product of erosive processes on the existing structure of the rocks involved and cannot be understood or explained without a good understanding of the geologic structure of the rocks. A geologist trying to decipher the structural geology of a region begins by studying the clues in the landforms. All is related. Now, there is a tendency of some geographers to think that geomorphology is a subdivision of geography and try to explain landforms without a thorough understanding of the structure, petrology, and stratigraphy on which the surface landforms develop. Landforms cannot be understood without knowledge of the geology on which they are formed.
Now, after all that, both articles are in need of improvement - as are most Wiki articles. So - someday someone will work 'em over (hopefully for improvement) and maybe I will (just don't hold your breath -)

By any standard the article is as complete as it can be at present - like other articles are meant to be.

'What we do know, is that surely that the article is 'incomplete' since we can only provide information on just two officers' It's an article about Islay Herald surely, not others?  

I am not sure what the Shirra has to do with this. Surely it's documentary, graphic, archaeological etc evidence that counts, not the unreferenced thoughts of the early 19th century Scotland's answer to Jeffrey Archer.

Though in one respect you are quite right. The article is incomplete - there is no reference to F  J Grant's little book - Islay is on p 11 of gthe 1914 edition - available as a pdf download online.

""""The Scottish officers of arms formed an important part
of the Royal Household, and were in attendance on the
King on all occasions of state. Besides the duties enumerated
above, they were employed in accompanying embassies
abroad, making royal proclamation throughout the country,
carrying important messages of state between the King and
his subjects, and a summons for treason could only be
served by a herald or pursuivant.
As early as 1364 mention is made of William Pittolloch,
Herald; and in 1365, in the Great Seal Register, of John
Trupour, Carrick Herald (probably a mistake for pursuivant).
Lyon Herald appears in 1377, and ten years
later as Lyon King of Heralds. Rothesay Herald, officer
of the Prince of Scotland, is first mentioned in 1401:
Marchmont, a title derived from Marchmont, the ancient
name of the Royal Castle of Roxburgh, in 1436 ; Snowdoun,
derived from a part of Stirhng Castle, in 1448; Albany,
from the Duke of Albany, a title of one of the King's sons,
in 145 1 (he is called pursuivant, however, in 1447); Ross,
from the Royal Earldom of the same, in 1474; and tslay,
from the island of that name, in 1493. Other heralds are
also found from time to time, such as Ireland in 1498 and
Orkney in 1581.
Of the pursuivants, Carrick, Pursuivant of the Prince, who
was Earl of Carrick, appears first in the year 1365 ; Unicorn in
1426; Aliszaiin 1426; Dragancein 1429; Diligence in 1472;
Dingwall in 1479; Montrose, Bute and Ormond in 1488;
Falkland in 1493; Ireland and Kintyre in 1495 '> March in
1515 ; and Ettrick, """"pretendit pursuivant,"""" in 157 1.
The number of heralds and pursuivants became fixed at
The Heraldic Executive
six of each by the reign of King James VI., and continued
at this number till by the Act of 1867 their numbers were
gradually reduced to three of each as vacancies occurred.
The titles now [at the time of writing] in use are Ross, Rothesay, and Albany for
the heralds; and March, Unicorn, and Carrick for the
pursuivants"""".

 I don't get it. 

So if someone would be to travel through time, their actions would have no effect?

But time travel itself affects the past  you're taking something from the present and putting it in a different point in time, thus, for the context of the earlier point in time you travel to, introducing matter/energy/whatever that didn't exist there before, thus (as per chaos theory) possibly screwing up everything. Any successful travel through time would have an effect, otherwise it wouldn't be time travel.

With that in mind  does the principle boil down to """"time travel is only possible if it has no effect, thus time travel (the possibility of which necessitates having an effect) is not possible""""?

The matter and energy of which the time traveller (and his clothing, etc) consists would (if the universe is a closed system) have been in use by something else at an earlier point in time and thus a re-allocation of matter and energy already existent at that earlier point in time to recreate the time traveller doesn't seem to be a viable alternative either. But if the time traveller can neither be composed of matter and energy that didn't exist, nor of that which already existed but was """"in use"""" already, what does he consist of?

Even if the universe is not a temporally closed system (i.e. matter/energy can vanish and re-appear at future points in time), for something to vanish in the present and re-appear in the past, it would have to vanish before its original appearance unless it can't exist twice at the same point in time (i.e. if atom A was sent back in time from a point Z to a point X, it would vanish at point Z (now) and appear at point X (back then) as A', but have to vanish again as time advances closer to the point Y (somewhere before point Z) where it was originally introduced as A, otherwise A and A' (which should be identical) would exist at the same point in time, which would definitely be an alteration of past events and thus incompatible with the principle.

I'm assuming the principle isn't based on the simplification of the idea that the only thing that """"matters"""" is the action/inaction of humans (as in the interpretation of Schroedinger's experiment that the cat is in an unknown state where it is both alive and dead until the human interacts with it  which implies the human's perception determines the state of reality). If that is true, then the example from Twilight Zone where someone goes back in history to start the fire he travelled back in time to prevent is clearly contradictory as it introduces a paradox (a time travel having to have occurred in order for the time travel to occur) unless it actually changed the events (i.e. originally the fire would have been caused by something else), which would still be inconsistent with the principle which doesn't allow for any changes of the past.

I'm aware this post is getting a bit rant-y, but I'm seriously at a loss here. How does time travel NOT change the past, regardless of whether it has any consequences in the grand scheme of things or not? The very concept of travel backwards through time is that one appears at an earlier point of time, thus changing the past.

The only possibility I can think of for time travel not to change the past is a paradox in which the time travel happens because it has already occurred (i.e. the future representation (person A') of someone (person A) appears in the present and at some future point in time the same events cause person A to travel back in time that """"already"""" caused person A' to go back in time, i.e. both of their time lines are identical), but in which there is no """"other"""" time line in which the time traveller didn't already appear before travelling back in time (i.e. there is no time line in which person A travels back in time without person A' having travelled in time already, i.e. where person A doesn't eventually become person A', the time traveller).

All of this is obviously rendered null and void if the laws of physics are inconsistent and random stuff does appear out of thin air for no reason. —  (talk · contribs) """

Nothing in my writing here is controvertial and in need of citation. It can all be looked up by the reader on any level. Do you need citations that dogs did not decend thousands of years ago from the wolves that are alive today, as most people believe? Do I need proof that they decended thousands of years ago from the wolves that LIVED thousands of years ago? Why does this need citation? Is this your problem? I am merely pointing out the error that so many, many people make. They hear that dogs decended from wolves, and they look around and see the only wolves left in the world in any number today are the wolves of northern lattitudes...they see the grey wolf of northern Eursaia and the timber wolf of North America, and believe that all dogs decended from them. Humans are a tropical creature that moved into the colder regions. Everywhere man goes, wolf populations dwindle, as anybody knows, and in ancient times, before man, there were wolves all over the world, adapted to their own climates. What part of this needs citation? Obviously, the first dogs to be bred were the ones where the people first lived, which is obviously the warmer climates, and it was THESE wolves that gave rise to most of our dog breeds, not the northern wolves. Now the wolves of the colder regions are the only ones left in number, the wolves in warmer places, where dogs were first bred, are almost all gone. Some northern breeds decended from northern wolves, yes. The spitz breeds and sled dogs, etc. This is all so obviuous, can you tell me what part of this you don't understand, and need citations about? I feel like I am talking to a child. If I tell my child that George Washington was the first president, to I have to give a citation? This stuff doesn't need citation.

You are a vandal, because you, as the only person on earth who doesn't agree with this, erased three whole paragraphs, not once but twice, on the grounds that there were no references, even though much larger tracts of the article are more controvertial and have no citations. You erased every word I wrote, even though all of it is true, none of it is controversial, and this is nothing but pure vandalism.

You need citation that dogs interbreed with coyotes? Why? How can you not already know that? How is this possible? And articles about the Russian jackal-dog hybrid are all over the web. Can you use a search engine? Look up the pre-caudal gland in any veterinary text. Things that are controvertial or new need citations to the new or controvertial sources, but when something become so widely-known that it can be found in every reference work out there, it no longer needs specific citation. For anything I wrote, you can look it up in Britannica. If you read something that you did not know, it doesn't mean the author needs to cite references for you, it just means you need to do your own homework. I am merely pointing out the things that are such a big part of common knowledge, and using them to prove that dogs did not all decend entirely from modern wolves of the colder climate where people didn't even live when dogs were first domesticated. In all my years of veterinary practice, I have probably told 100's of my patients that dogs decended from warm-climate wolves, NOT all of them come from the northern wolves. Now, after all these years, I am confronted by a web vandal who tells me I have to cite freaking references about this. It is purely annoying. 

If you erase my writings again I will report you as a vandal. Really, do NOT do it again.

Shapiro is no more notable than medical doctors who have had their licenses suspended, or revoked.

 Hi Nabeelsahab, thanks for the note. There are a number of problems with your edit on Zad al-Ma'ad. Firstly, the content you added seems to have been copied and pasted from http://www.kalamullah.com/zaad-al-maad.html. The text is therefore copyrighted material and should be removed. Please see Wikipedia:Copy-paste.

Secondly, Wikipedia articles are required to present a neutral point of view based on reliable secondary sources. Websites such as kalamullah.com are not considered reliable due to there polemic and sectarian nature. Neutral sources include media agencies such as the BBC or academic sources. Please read WP:RS. There are a number of academic sources on Ibn Qayyim such as the works of Livnat Holtzman and Jon Hoover which you should consider looking into that might provide reliable and accurate information about Zad al-Ma'ad.

Thirdly, the language of the article needs to be Encyclopedic. Claims such as """"This book is one of the important resources of knowledge for those who seek to know the Seerah.."""" seems to be an example of puffery. Please read  WP:PUFF.

Fourthly, adding statements such as """"Available from Australian Islamic Library website"""" seems to be a clear case of WP:PROMOTION. Zad al-Ma'ad is available in a whole series of websites such as http://d1.islamhouse.com/data/en/ih_books/single/en_Complete_Zaad_al_Maad.pdf, http://idci.co.uk/Provisions-For-The-Hereafter-Mukhtasar-Zad-Al-maad-699-d etc.... so there is no need to specify the Australian Islamic Library in particular.

Avoidant vandalism Removing {{afd}},  and other related tags in order to conceal deletion candidates or avert deletion of such articles. Note that this is often mistakenly done by new users who are unfamiliar with *fD procedures and such users should be given the benefit of the doubt and pointed to the proper page to discuss the issue.
Changing people's comments Editing signed comments by another user to substantially change their meaning (e.g. turning someone's vote around), except when removing a personal attack (which is somewhat controversial in and of itself).  Signifying that a comment is unsigned is an exception. e.g. (unsigned comment from user)

Talk page vandalism Deleting the comments of other users from article Talk pages, aside from removal of internal spam, or deleting entire sections of talk pages, is generally considered vandalism. Removing personal attacks is often considered legitimate, and it is considered acceptable to archive an overly long Talk page to a separate file and then remove the text from the main Talk page.  The above does not apply to the user's own Talk page, where users generally are permitted to remove and archive comments at their discretion, except in cases of legitimate warnings, which they are generally prohibited from removing, especially where the intention of the removal is to mislead other editors.

We've already discussed the Big Chin to death.  It was one of many allegations of photo manipulation dismissed by the HSCA. You want to mention it as if 1) it was never debunked 2) it's the most important thing ever 3) it is proof of conspiracy.    

Gamaliel, none of the three things you just wrote make any logical sense. 1)Some believe the chin is not a fabrication. So what? This doesn't mean these true believers have """"debunked"""" something. Its their opinion. The policy of this web site is to provide all opinions, and certainly not to hide the evidence. When are you going to understand this rule? 2) How important is it? It is relevant to Oswald's contention that some one was framing him. Whether that is the """"most important thing ever' is up to the reader. 3) Whether it is proof of a conspiracy is also up to the reader. 

Gamaliel, your frantic attempts to delete and hide any information that you disagree with is directly contrary to the web site rules. Why do you continue to do it?
 

Don't forget, there were two Oswald's. Lee Oswald and Harvey Oswald. One worked for the CIA and was the real triggerman, I forget which... But wait a minute, the fatal shot really came from the grassy knoll, from an anti-Castro Cuban, who wanted payback, for no air-support for Brigade 2506, during the Bay of Pigs disaster... No wait a minute Oswald was a paid hitman for the mafia...... oh well It's 3:37 in the AM, all this conspiracy stuff is making me loopy. Goodnight.
 

Gamaliel, is this person above who calls himself """"Mytwocents"""" your alter ego, and put in for comic relief?

 

Web site rules of inclusion of all significant viewpoints

The evidence of the fabricated photograph is a significant viewpoint that was discussed in the HSCA report. Some experts believe it shows fabricationsome don't. Under the rules of this web site all significant viewpoints should be presented. 

Claiming that someone else disagrees with a significant viewpoint on a subject is not a ground for excluding it from the article. 

Arguing it is not the """"most important thing ever"""" is not a ground for excluding the view point that the photographs are fabrications. 

Arguing that evidence that the photographs were fabricated is evidence of a conspiracy,  is not a ground for excluding the evidence.

Gentlemen. These are basic web site rules.

Don't leave  after every goddamn sentence in a paragraph.  Use one tag; .  Free free to argue about content, but make sure the current content is at least readable.  I have just fixed a couple of paragraphs; I'm about to go after any others.

Control my anger?  What are you talking about?  I'm not in a position to verify either way - I just want to make sure that the article is readable for the users.

This article is not neutral

Surely it's not the job of Wikipedia contributors to decide whether or not Oswald worked alone, was part of a conspiracy or had anything to do with the assassination at all.  It seems to me that the only way of rendering a neutral article is to state that Oswald was arrested and held on suspicion of Kennedy's murder, but was killed before he could be tried.  It can then be provably stated that the Warren Commission, in its Report, concluded that Oswald was guilty and had worked alone, but that there have since been many efforts and arguments that attempt to disprove this conclusion.  

It's not our business to decide what really happened, which is what some people here are trying to do.  We are here to report on and check verifiable facts, not persuade peop"

As it stands, I think that reporting his Titstare comments and people's reaction to them, without mentioning that he was subsequently fired over a history of Twitter comments that were perceived as sexist, etc. (but that he defended as satirical) would be missing the bigger picture.

Bugging America

The Liberties of the Subject

By WERTHER

The overwhelming balance of recorded history has been marked by despotism. When homo sapiens sapiens transitioned from hunter gatherer to agriculturalist, he gained literacy, solid dwellings, and other accoutrements of what is commonly considered civilization. But he experienced a sharp decline in personal liberty.

The reasons for this are commonsensical. Disputes between tribes of hunter gatherers could be resolved by one or the other simply pulling up stakes and relocating to a new territory, there being few material impedimenta to prevent them. A settled agricultural existence, on the other hand, implied permanent villages, granaries, and land boundaries to be defended against depredation. The need for defenses implied a national security state. Agricultural surpluses not only necessitated armed defense, but allowed a division of labor leading to policemen, soldiers, bureaucrats, and tax assessors, the latter of whom would confiscate a percentage of the harvest.

The evolution of labor conditions also implied a different mental outlook. The hunter gatherer was an independent contractor (if not brigand) who ranged over extensive territory and worked alone or in small groups. The agricultural laborer, by contrast, toiled in one spot, making his comings and goings more subject to regulation.

If the land was not his, he became dependent on the Big Man's favor. Given the increased population densities in regions where agricultural societies developed, he could only rarely strike out on his own: the good land had been already taken, and game animals cleared or hunted to local extinction. [1]

With the rise of what Karl Wittfogel call """"hydraulic civilization,"""" [2] the screw of oppression turned once again against personal liberty. In order to build the extensive earthworks necessary for the state to survive the next drought or flood, the rulers of these proto-superpowers subjected their subjects to enforced toil and off-duty regimentation which rendered them no more free than so many draft animals.

It is unlikely the rulers of the states in the Valley of Mexico, the Nile, the Euphrates, the Ganges, or the Yang-Tze had much toleration for the complaints their subjects, who were enslaved, enserfed, or otherwise regimented for the greater good as defined by the states' rulers. These complaints, had they been permitted, would have constituted freedom of speech.

Nor would the rulers have given credence to a peasant's assertion that the interior of his crude dwelling, and the contents thereof, were inviolate from the inquisitiveness of the state. He, the peasant, simply had no rights a ruler was bound to respect (to paraphrase what a former Supreme Court Justice once said about slaves in a famous ruling in 1857); the only limit on a ruler's power over his subjects was the former's fear of rebellion should discontent overflow.

Of the two rights discussed thus far, freedom of speech and freedom from arbitrary search and seizure, the latter is fundamentally more important to human beings' maintaining a status above that of mere hive animals. This is not intended in any way to disparage the desirability and necessity of free speech. But there are practical circumstances when free speech is not exercised by reasonable peopledue to reticence, shame, or its merely being not worth the effort. Or when one is married.

Much obnoxious and exhibitionistic behavior is rationalized as free speech, while more urgent matters are suppressed: how many hourly employees feel free to say what they really think of their supervisors, and is the resultant lawsuit really covered by the First Amendment? But asinine reality TV blares on. Out of politeness or discretion, most intelligent people censor their opinions about politics, in-laws, bosses, and religion when they are in the public commons.

The inviolability of one's person, and one's dwelling, is more basic. What would the average person resent more: being told he cannot ask questions of the President of the United States at a staged event, or being ordered to be strip searched in public? Or, for that matter, have his house ransacked? That is the principle at issue. The lesser freedom is essential for political discourse, the greater freedom distinguishes us from dogs. [3]

Respect for privacy, for oneself and one's fellow citizens, is the benchmark of a sense of an individual self. The majority of psychologically well adjusted people believes that there are facts and circumstances about them that just do not bear the glaring searchlight of public revelation. Some things are simpl"

I kindly ask you to explain the connection between the Russian revolution and Central Lithuania before you put back the category.

Babe Ruth's infobox lists him as a """"Right fileder / Left fielder / Pitcher."""" I find that silly. In my opinion it should say, """"Pitcher / Outfielder."""" Number one, it's more correct cronologically, and number two, do we really need to split up the outfield positions on an infobox? I could understand putting """"Left fielder"""" for someone like Barry Bonds or Ted Williams or someone else who spent his entire career at one outfield position, but when he's played more than one outfield position, splitting it up like that is a little bit too much information and just makes the infobox look cumbersome.

As for whitewashing, well - I do trust documents, not opinions.

Also you should note, that the book notes change in the press and the recognition of the problem 
Also you should note, that this books is 12 years out of a print and does not say a word about most recent research (This also leads to assumption, that information is more than 12 years old, since a book is not written in a day).  And Bubnys research is much more """"fresh"""" in this respect, because it is published in 2003.

 WikiCup 2014 February newsletter 

And so ends the most competitive first round we have ever seen, with 38 points required to qualify for round 2. Last year, 19 points secured a place; before that, 11 (2012) or 8 (2011) were enough. This is both a blessing and a curse. While it shows the vigourous good health of the competition, it also means that we have already lost many worthy competitors. Our top three scorers were:

, a WikiCup newcomer whose high-quality scans of rare banknotes represent an unusual, interesting and valuable contribution to Wikipedia. Most of Godot's points this round have come from a large set of pictures used in Treasury Note (1890–91).
, a WikiCup veteran and a finalist last year, Adam is also a featured picture specialist, focusing on the restoration of historical images. This month's promotions have included a carefully restored set of artist William Russell Flint's work.
, another WikiCup newcomer. WikiRedactor has claimed points for good article reviews and good articles relating to pop music, many of which were awarded bonus points. Articles include Sky Ferreira, Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus and """"Wrecking Ball"""" (Miley Cyrus song).

Other competitors of note include:

, who helped take Thirty Flights of Loving through good article candidates and featured article candidates, claiming the first first featured article of the competition.
, who claimed the first featured list of the competition with Natalia Kills discography.
, who takes the title of the contributor awarded the highest bonus point multiplier (resulting in the highest scoring article) of the competition so far. Her high-importance salamander, now a good article, scored 108 points.

After such a competitive first round, expect the second round to also be fiercely fought. Remember that any content promoted after the end of round 1 but before the start of round 2 can be claimed in round 2, but please do not update your submission page until March (UTC). Invitations for collaborative writing efforts or any other discussion of potentially interesting work is always welcome on the WikiCup talk page. Remember, if two or more WikiCup competitors have done significant work on an article, all can claim points equally.

If you are concerned that your nomination—whether it is at good article candidates, a featured process, or anywhere else—will not receive the necessary reviews, please list it on Wikipedia:WikiCup/Reviews. If you want to help out with the WikiCup, please do your bit to help keep down the review backlogs!

What ? Command-by-command ? No interpreter is using such crappy technique nowadays. Taw

 From Interpreted Language/Talk 
 
some languages (like Perl) are compiled at runtime

Could you elaborate ? Taw

Every time a perl script is run, Perl compiles it and then runs the compiled code. At least, this is the usual way of using perl, although it's not the only way. Zundark, 2001 Dec 15

You mean compile to syntactic tree or compile to machine code ? Taw

 I believe it's compiled to bytecode, much like Java. As of perl 5.6 (version?), it's possible to produce a bytecode version of a perl program to save the compilation step. I think the bytecode can be converted back to full source as well, but I'm not as sure about that. Indigo Perl (http://www.indigoperl.com) produces a perl compiler that produces a machine executable, but I think the resulting executable consists of both the actual bytecode and enough of the perl engine to run the bytecode, so they tend to be rather large. Their advantage is being able to deploy the code to machines that don't necessarily have the Perl interpreter installed.  They have versions for both Windows and Unix-ish platforms.  Wesley

 Old Interpreted Language article 

An interpreted language is a type of programming language that is not compiled into machine code, but is interpreted at run-time by the computer, and translated into machine understandable code as required.

It is often a mistake to refer to a language as either """"interpreted"""" or """"compiled"""", because
most languages can be implemented in either way, and some languages
(like Perl) are compiled at
runtime but behave as if they were interpreted.
Other languages, like Java, may be partially compiled into an
intermediate form which is then interpreted (although that, too, might be compiled).
Some languages, though, are specifically designed to favor interpretation.

An example of an interpreted language is JavaScript.

Is Java interpreted, or what? 

The Java programming language article says:

""""The first implementations of the language used an interpreted virtual machine to achieve portability, and many implementations still do. These implementations produce programs that run more slowly than the fully-compiled programs created by the typical C++ compiler and some later Java language compilers, so the language suffered a reputation for producing slow programs. More recent implementations of the Java VM produce programs that run much faster, using multiple techniques.""""

The Java language is compiled, always.  It is designed as a compiled language, and is implemented as a compiled language.  It is often compiled into bytecode, which is then interpreted (with a virtual machine).  I think the Java language article is correct, but maybe it could be worded better.  LDC

Yes, and you can also compile Jave straight down to machine code if you like. The above claim that it is a mistake to differentiate between interpreted and compiled languages is IMHO incorrect; every language that has an """"eval"""" statement which lets you construct and evaluate statements on the fly can never be cleanly compiled down to machine code; you will always have to embed an interpreter in your compiled code. AxelBoldt

Way too much mess here has been caused by lack of clear definition of """"compiling"""".
It is used in two distinct meanings, as in:
 compiled to machine code (or assembly)
 compiled to byte code/parse tree/some other internal representation

I think it's wrong to call languages that use the second way """"compiled"""". In such case there would be virtually no interpreted language in use - no language uses line-by-line parsing nowadays, all """"compile"""" source to some form of internal representation.

Quote from FOLDOC:
     Compiler

     A program that converts another program
     from some {source language} (or {programming language}) to
     {machine language} (object code).  Some compilers output
     {assembly language} which is then converted to {machine
     language} by a separate {assembler}.

The images
As I have stated long ago, this article has a couple of image problems. Many have been uploaded on commons with an antiquated and questionable PD rationale, and are likely to get deleted in the near future. What's more, the image in the infobox comes to us from the self-published book of a Holocaust denier - although it was uploaded, I presume, in good-faith - who cannot claim PD for the images, but (as he does) only for the text. I presume the PD release for the text is there to help him popularize such nonsense (""""read me, copy me""""), but the images are still copyrighted by their original authors, from whom the author took his images without proper credit. Unless I see some serious arguments as to why to keep the images, sometime in the near future, I myself will visit wikicommons with a couple of deletion requests.

Since then, he has made 2 edits: one on September 30 on Arizona's page and then yesterday on A change Is Gonna Come yesterday but to become active again he had to make 5 edits over the course of 2 weeks.

My question is: am I right to have sent him a new message to notify him his inactivity of 2 months? Or did I have to wait one more week to see if he would have done 3 more edits? Does the user that becomes semi-active have to make the required edits in the 2 weeks following the notification or do we count starting the moment he makes a new edit? Do you understand my questions lol? If I should have waited then I'll erase my message...
Also, I forgot to send Mattom 123 an semi-active user notification on September 28. I could send him now a message but the problem is that he edited the ninth season today and on October 1 so if I send him a message it would be weird because now he has made edits.

You're conflating issues here. This is not an assumption of bad faith; it's adhering to what the source actually says. William M. Connolley's extemporaneous comments here are not a source; the publication (RealClimate) is the source.

This is just a frank evaluation of what the source says; RealClimate says nothing about who worked on the article or how it was written, but we know that unsigned """"group"""" pieces are often not equivalent to joint authorship. For another analogy, consider per curium legal opinions. """"Per curium"""" means that all of the judges or justices agreed, but it's a very different thing from all of them signing the opinion. Typically, they're less controversial cases, so one judge's clerk writes the opinion, then they're circulated for comment. But the other judges typically don't scrutinize it as closely as if their name was on the line; there are many examples of judges railing against dicta that they theoretically endorsed just a couple of years earlier—sometimes even within the same case. Unanimous opinions (where every judge signs) are different, and they reflect a higher level of collaboration, as in Brown v. Board of Education. 

The bottom line is that the source itself doesn't say who wrote it. The commentators on BLP/N seem to think this is an important distinction.  Luke """

 I hope you do not mind me asking but why is the name of the page the same as your username? You asked for help, well to wikify an article it means adding appropriate sections (which it has) and linking internally to other article which are relevant, for more info see Wikipedia:Wikify. For example in the character and history sections you could make an interwiki link on the word Villain by doing this: [[Villain]] and it would produce Villain. To link to an article with a slightly different word for example you wanted villainous to link to villain you would put [[Villain|Villainous]] and this would link the word villainous to villain.

Ashnard is my favourite Fire Emblem character, so I thought it would be fitting to create/edit a page involving him as my first article, thanks for the advice, I will always try to improve the standard of articles. THANKS!!  talk 
 Hey 

Very strange.

You know what? Ashnard reminds me of Colonel Volgin. (You've played MGS:3 I assume.)
That's not good, by the way... do you like him too? Just picking on you, but still... it's a weird character to like soooo much. If it makes you feel better, I didn't like Ike too much, but don't you dare talk crap about Greil. Err. See you around, Ol' King Daein. Peregrine 

 Yes, I have played MGS3, I love that game, I am also quite partial to Greil (although I prefer to call him Gawain). Ashnard is quite like Volgin, but Ashnard isn't a bisexual pervert. So...Thanks for the comment, I'm really starting to get use to this place.  talk

Oh, Rolf... give him a chance. Atleast he's not an idiot like Boyd, or walking around with his eyes closed all the time like Oscar! He's still a kid, he could, uh... ya know, toughen up as he ages. (Maybe we'll see in GoD, who knows? Sothe definetely came a long way... if he just ditched that belly shirt) Plus, he's a sniper...so snipers rock, right? Tingle frightens me to my core, ahhh. I am not fond of that fairy-loving, body suit wearing freak with little man boobies. Have you played Twilight Princess? Looking back I don't think Tingle was in it at all. Thank goodness.

0,"Cobden, Ontario

Hello, I'm a moderate user of wikipedia. My Opus for this site has to be the article I wrote on Cobden, Ontario. This is my home town and I did a lot of research into it's history and everything so that I could make a good article on it. I have received a lot of comments from people in my town about the article and a lot of them have told me they learned things that they didn't know before. Recently a user named Bearcat has merged a lot of stub articles into the article about their region. I'm not sure what the policy is on this. Most of the articles were about very unnotible places (mclarens settlement being the best example). But I'm a little unclear on why he seems to insist on merging cobden aswell. The article was over 10,000 words long. I know that there doesn't need to be articles on everything on earth but, and I realize I may be the minority on this, it seems like towns  should have their own articles. I mean.... people may want information about them and it was hard for me to find it all. Now the information is all broken up and scattered across the whitewater region article. 

Anyways, the reason I'm bothering you with this is because you seem like you would probably know a little more about wikipolicy than me and I saw you get involved before. I guess you could say I'm asking for your help and opinion. And my main question is this: Are towns not worthy, ever, of their own article?

No, the planning took place in response to the Winter War. The British government may have been half hearted as Nick-D says, but certainly not the French nor the British public and press. From the Doerr paper Paul cites:
""""The reaction of the British public and press to the Soviet invasion of Finland was overwhelmingly hostile. Sympathy for Finland was strong. The Finns were seen as a small, embattled liberal state defying a totalitarian power. As the Finns battled against increasingly long odds, pressure grew on the British government to do something. Military supplies were sent to Finland along with some British volunteers. By March 1940 public pressure and pressure from the French forced the British government to agree to a wild plan to send British troops to Finland.""""
Do not forget that the French were considered a major military power in 1939, so while the British may have been reluctant, I don't see why we should ignore the French pressure for intervention.   """

You  are under the influence of a severe WP:COI attack. Remember a COI could be spotted not only by defending but also by attacking a particular project/idea (like you are doing here).
You have erased (I think it was you even when that edition it is not signed) the independent links that support the inclusion of SERVA in this page. You have erased links to articles written by many different people from many different languages, you have erased the kind of link you couldn't provide for supporting the projects that you are SPONSORING here.
My proposed changes are based in facts that you cannot take (and dare to erase); You are PROMOTING projects here; you do not provide independent sources, then I do not have to convince you. You are definitely biased here.

I want to report  for erasing the research material I have included when supporting one of the projects ERASED by him in this page.

1)  systematiclly refuses to provide the bases for supporting COBBLER inclusion. He does not have/know how to articulate the support for the mentioned project. I encourage talk to finally provide to the WP community the supporting material for the inclusion of this project here. He is the one that systematically forces the inclusion of this project; it has to be him who knows and proves to the community the value of the mentioned project. My guideline based argument for removing COBBLER is that that project it is not representative of the PXE state of art.

I want to report  as a biased editor whose behavior could be very well understood under the terms of WP:COI.

2) You cannot say ditto; the guideline based argument for removing EL TORITO  was clearly stated before; you are definitely not WP:LISTENing here. EL TORITO has nothing to do with PXE.

3) Again a magnificent display of WP:COI; your COI. You are trying to twist things putting the blame on me but that will not change facts: There is no independent material available for supporting the inclusion of ERPXE. Peroid. Again it is YOU who scream COI here while supporting one of your projects. Bring the material and I'll shut up. If not it isn't me the one that has to shut up here.

4) your WP:COI is amazing; you cannot take defeat; and no matter what I write you want to promote the projects that you want while banning SERVA. If I bring links you erase the links, if I bring facts and arguments you call me """"dead horse"""". You do not care about WP you just care about not bending your arm. You have no clue about PXE but you pretend to rule how the PXE page is written based on your guts feelings and personal taste.

Notability of Rockford's Rock Opera
A tag has been placed on Rockford's Rock Opera requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

This work has been going on for a long long time and is far superior to the IPA system (which 99% of people are not familiar with anyway) and superior to the RTGS system (outdated but still used unfortunately) because it has tonal marks and uses only English letters.

The pronunciation I offer is a big improvement on what is out there at the moment and it is something that english speakers can follow easily."

The tugging method used to restore foreskin like the kind offered at http://tlctugger.com/ increase skin slack in the penis and improve the function fixing some of the issues but not all. Of course the only way to fix it is to prevent the infant circumcision in the first place.

White House circumcision petition needs signers up to and on OCT 23 https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/petition/ban-non-therapeutic-routine-infant-circumcision/2tqgSZtG Routine infant circumcision is in direct violation of human rights. It is also against the Hippocratic Oath; which states: """"Do no harm."""" Circumcision is harmful to infants and the men that they will become. A circumcision itself takes 1/3 to 1/2 of the male shaft skin on the penis. It also takes over 2000 fine touch nerve sensors, the gentle gliding mechanism that is offered by the foreskin, and the protection of the foreskin itself. It causes unnecessary pain to the infant and the anesthesia does not block all the pain that an infant feels. In 1993, a ban was formed against genital cutting of infant females. Under the law the ban should also cover male infants too as the equal protection act states. It's time for all sexes to be protected from this barbaric practice.

pho·bi·a (fō'bē-ə): A persistent, abnormal, and irrational fear of a specific thing or situation that compels one to avoid it, despite the awareness and reassurance that it is not dangeroushttp://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Phobia.

 According to the Organisation of The Islamic Conference: 
""""Islamophobia signifies the contemporary proliferation of discrimination against Muslims and distortion of Islam and is partly due to the ignorance and lack of understanding of Islam in the West. It would be an unfortunate error in judgment in believing that Islam is linked to terror; that it is intolerant of other religious beliefs, that its values and practices are not democratic; that it favors repression of freedom of expression and undermining human rights.""""http://www.oic-oci.org/uploads/file/Islamphobia/Islamophobia_rep_May_23_25_2009.pdf

Victorian Station Master's Academy for Wiki Editors

On Oct 14, 2005, at 3:20 AM, ANTIGRAY@cs.com wrote:

Victorian Station Masters Academy
Founded 1839

Greetings Prospective Station Masters.
This course leads to an SM Degree.

At Victorian Station Masters Academy rigorous training for a position with a great future (but anchored firmly in the past) awaits you.

We will train you to be a respected Station Master (SM) in the time-honored tradition of being an unimaginative SM who unduly emphasizes minutiae in the presentation or use of his knowledge, and can narrowly, stodgily, and often ostentatiously show how learned they are.

Our graduates learn all the basics a great Station Master must master.
You will be taught to be dull, ill-natured, and ill-humored, and narrowly inflexible in standards of conduct. The public expects this.

A Station Master must be Self Righteous, convinced of his own righteousness especially in contrast with the actions and beliefs of others and narrow-mindedly moralistic.

You will learn to be:
Hidebound, extremely old-fashioned, tedious, tiresome because of the length or dullness of your prognostications, pompously Victorian, slow in perception or sensibility, and lacking brilliance or luster.
Our graduates are renowned for having an inflexible and ultraconservative character.

We offer advanced classes in arrogance, imperiousness, and special workshops to practice irritably sullen and churlish mood and manner. 

Learn an imperious manner marked by arrogant assurance, so as to exercise arbitrary or overbearing control over and tyrannize subordinates.   
All Station Masters are taught to be MASTERFUL. When you graduate, you will have the ability to act authoritatively with an obstinate determination to enforce one's will.

Our graduates typify the moral standards, attitudes, and conduct of the age of Victoria. You will take pride in being a stuffy and hypocritical representative figure of the Victorian era.  

Applications to register for the Class of 2006 are available at all train stations during normal business hours.

""""Station Masters always know their station in life."""" 

========================
Jack,
Now you know where they get their training.

Pre-inflation unstable false-vacuum is pretty much like the massless vacuum Puthoff & Co are currently stuck in leading them nowhere.

Phase transition to our universe, one of an infinity, forms the giant local vacuum wave AKA Higgs field. The fabric of space-time is the FM modulation of the Goldstone Phase of this Tsunami inside the post-inflationary vacuum starting off in the hot Big Bang as per orthodox theory. The dark zero point energy comes from the AM modulation of the Higgs field and is in two universal forms one repulsive and on attractive. On the large scale ~ 73& of vacuum is repulsive, 23% attractive. We are only a tiny % of total after you subtract off the hydrogen-helium gas clouds of proto-star stuff.

Metric engineering of WWD & Wormhole is simply getting a Josephson type effect phase-lock to the macro-quantum vacuum phase.

B(x) = (hG/c^3)^1/2'd'(Vacuum Phase - Control Phase)

The local invariant scalar metric field is of the form

g(x) = (1 + B(x))(Flat Space Time)(1 + B(x)) = guv(x)dx^udx^v

Hello, StAnselm: I recently updated James Dobson's page to include his comments in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting; however, you were involved in the process of removing my update pending further discussion. Mr. Dobson chose to opine on this very serious and significant event merely days after it occurred, and the nature of the statement he delivered on his broadcast is very much in keeping with his views on American culture and values. Wikipedia serves a multitude of purposes, not least of which is to provide clear and (hopefully) unbiased materials that may be used by others to amass factual information and formulate their own views and opinions. I believe that Mr. Dobson's prompt commentary on this significant current event warrants inclusion in his Wikipedia page, particularly when other pieces of information, such as Dobson's delivery of the pre-race invocation at a NASCAR event in 2010, are deemed suitable for his Wikipedia page."

Mr. Haider, the theory that Pashtuns are an East Iranian people is the most scientific theory about Pashtun origin based on linguistic and anthropological studies/evidences contrary to other theories which are just wild speculations and fantastic fairy tales. So please, now that Pashtun ethnography has taken proper course, don't push it back to speculative histography by making irrational proclaimations that """"Pashtuns are an old race of its own"""" and that """"Pashtuns are great"""". This is an encyclopedia article and it should relect the dominent academic view about Pashtun origin instead of folkloric myths. 

Further, in detail every ethnic group has a distinct culture but on general level, different ethnic groups align with each other to form super groups with the same cultural, linguistic, and ethnic roots. There really was a proto-Iranian language, ethnicity, and culture. Anthropology, linguistics, and even social structure align Pashtuns with other Iranian people. This is a fact that cannot be refuted with mere sermises and conjectures.

I further inform the editors that Pashtun population in Karachi was 1.1 millions according to 1998 census of Pakistan. That might have swelled to at most 1.3-1.4 millions by now. I request the editors to exclude the statement like """"Pashtuns are twice the number of Pashtuns in Afghanistan"""" because, first proper population census of Afghanistan are yet to be held and second this statement would unnecessarily propogate the impression that """"Pashtuns are now well integrated in one state or the other"""". Moreover, we already have have Pashtun populations in various countries mentioned in the side bar. 

Further, I couldn't understand this term """"Punjabi Pathan""""? Why coin such term in the first place?

Hello Barto. I am curious as to what your motivation is in editing on the Ron Gostick page and are you the creator of it?  As stated on the talk page there, you are correct in stating that internet sources which are few come from mostly the extreme right or left.  These are terms both I and Ron, himself would acknowledge as being artificially misleading characterisations and could not be ascribed to him or the associates of the Canadian League of Rights. I could explain why here, but I won't bore you with the details.

However, I do reject the notion that everything must link to a Wiki article.  I am editing at another page, where there is no objection to verifiable external sourcesinternet or hard copy. I will not object to so-called Left or Right sources, as long as there are sources from external links to associations and people connected to Mr. Gostick.  The archives at the Australian League of Rights will have plenty of published materials on him, League objectives and views or anyone associated with him. This is one link that was removed in favor of David Lethbridge's document (hardly a non-politcally unbiased character considering he represents everything the opposite of what Gostick and the League of Rights stood for).

I will try to help you find sources, fair and credible in the near future, doing edits myself.  I just want to know if you have a bias of your own or are willing to be neutral on some claims made about him.  I know well what he and the League of Rights stand for, as I have been involved with it for near 30 yrs. There is no denying he was anti-totalitarianism and that includes anti-zionist, which automatically brings down the bogus smear of """"anti-semitism' and other such nonsense.  An editor should have at least some familiarity with the subject he is decidedly determined to write about.

I have notified Paul Fromm of the wiki page and link to him at Gostick's page, in case he didn't know it existed.  Be aware that Wikipedia has come under criticism for pages created on living persons, edited by vandals with damaging false claims unknown to the subject of the article until much later.  One was a recent high-level member of the Kennedy administration and believe me he made a public stink about it.  Living or dead, I don't care to see this happen to anyone. 

Feel free to post at my page in answer if you wish.  Do you have a wiki email or a private one? """

 You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible conflict of interest. 

Creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on articles for deletion. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself. This is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. All edits to articles must conform to Wikipedia:No original research, Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, and Wikipedia:Verifiability. 

If you are not """"notable"""" under Wikipedia guidelines, creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that Wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider and would thus qualify for speedy deletion.

0,""":It seems that you are right that the words of Rawat's mother were added  not mixed with, which leaves open the possibility of being obviously and thus deceptively interwoven, but added to some quotes of Rawat's in the quotes section of EPO.  But even a cynic like yourself must concede that it was probably an honest mistake.  First, there isn't a single other case of false attribution, mistaken or otherwise, that's ever been made out against EPO that I can recall.  John and Jean-Michel who've done most, if not all, the work have been meticulous throughout.  Plus, they have openly invited corrections if and when any mistakes were noted.  This is an opportunity for you, then, to make EPO even better.  Congratulations for doing a small part in bringing the truth about Rawat to the general publice.

Also, the Mata Ji quote is in a set of sample quotes from the book, Who Is Guru Maharaj Ji?.  It is just that.  The only error is that the quotes are in the section of Rawat's own quotes and not the more general category of all quotes of interest.  In other words a simple mistake just like you said. On the other hand, you also make accusations of quotes """"out of context"""".  You have offered no support at all for this accusation.  It's time you did or gave up that scurrilous accusation. On that score, you also alleged that the editors of the above book themselves wrote some of the quotes in question.  Where's your evidence for that?  I say there's none and if you know better now's the time to show your proof.  Otherwise, why say it?

But what's really funny is how you yourself are so clearly guilty of doing just that, taking quotes out of context.  For some reason you felt compelled to drag in comments from an ex-premie forum here.  Whatever the wisdom of that, you'd think you, a serious academic with a keen eye for """"contextual abuse"""" would know better than to say that I said you """"need to be slapped in the face"""" when what I really said was:

""""Her entire thesis is offensive and unsubstantiated by the evidence.  She deserves the academic equivalent of a slap in the face."""" (My emphasis).  

If you can't tell the difference, you're not fit to do the kind of careful analysis you purport to do.  If you can tell the difference, you're being purposely misleading and provocative.  Your choice.

Your insipid attempts to delete the l0de radio hour page disgust me, you miserable shell of a half-man. Consider yourself formally challenged to an honorable duel in international waters, which I have no doubt you will slink away from like the cowardly reptile you are. Without true conviction behind your statements, you do not even deserve to have a tongue, and I yearn for the days of old where speakers of untruth faced searing-tong glossectomy and abacination. Your furtive and manaical attempts to discredit those voting to keep exposes you as little more than a drooling ocd-riddled schizophrenic and I heartily encourage you to wash your hands and pick viciously at your many pustules and then wash your hands again until the vicious cycle exposes bare skull.

Response from coward ends.
dongs
As you are ignorant of even the most rudimentary conventions of honorable duelling it is my duty to inform you that it is the challenger, not the challenged who determines distance, as stated in rule #16 of the Codo Duello. You must also elaborate on the pistols to be used, otherwise I will assume any caliber semi-automatic is permissable. As you have chosen the grounds, you are also responsible for providing the boat on which the pistol duel will take place. If you are unable to find a boat with a large enough deck to accomodate an honorable duel (at least twenty paces of unobstructed space in a corridor ten feet wide) another option is that two smaller boats may be used, in calm seas. Inflatable rafts and non-motorized dingheys are not acceptable. I must commend you on selecting a cowardly weapon which greatly complicates the relatively straightforward process of an at-seas duel, you perfidious poltroon. Should you miraculously acquire vertabrae between now and the chosen date, I will gladly agree to a change in weapons, especially to epees. The time is acceptable to me. Please note that duels cannot take place within the jurisdiction of Canada, and therefore must take place at least 200 nautical miles (not standard miles) from the continental margin, to avoid breaking laws which expressly forbid dueling. 

I await the duel eagerly. Please offer my advance condolences to your family members.

The Peter Jackson series is not a franchise, it is one instance of an independently produced series in a franchise that includes multiple adaptations across multiple media. Batman is similar: Batman is a franchise that includes comics, multiple independent adaptations and merchandise. We could just have a chart of each independent series, but that would mean separating the Batman films, separating the Spider-Man films etc, but the chart does this anyway, because you can just expand the entries. The article retains a neutral point of view on what data we present, since readers may be just as interested in the collective value of the whole Batman franchise as opposed to just one series in it; on the other hand, they must just be interested in the Nolan series. Either way it doesn't matter because both sets of data are given. Likewise with the Middle Earth films, the reader has access to how much the franchise has earned as a whole, how much the Jackson series has earned as a whole, and how much just the LOTR trilogy within the Jackson series has earned as a whole. It covers all possible ways a reader might want to interpret the information.

This article still needs more work in my view; it is still too dependent on rumors and tabloid journalism sources.  Its sources are in many cases tabloid newspapers that rely on anonymous sources in their reporting and that convey unsupported rumors.

Frequently, when one tries to update this article with reliable third-party published sources, the updated information is being deleted with what appear to me to be explanations that are not supported by Wikipedia's own policies and guidelines for editing.

There is no requirement for """"legal"""" meaning of """"Domestic partnership"""" (""""domestic partner(s)"""") in the parameter of that infobox: Template:Infobox actor; it makes clear that the parameter refers to """"romantic relationships"""" in a more general sense.

 Well, hope the floor didn't hurt. But your characterization of my attitude and what I respect and don't is to say the least dubious. Did it occur to you that I didn't attend your schools, have different experiences, different parents, and can think for myself? There is plenty of room for differences in interpretation, as anyone that has mediated flame wars here, as I have can tell you. One cranky old editor spouting off does NOT make for a battle. OTOH, similar frank opinions have almost universally in the past resulted in a good working relationship, a clear communication, and about 3/4ths of the time, resulted in a new Wikifriend. So piffle to WP:CIVyou're not looking at the context, nor the intent of the context for that guideline. Being polite can in fact be counterproductive and a time waste, a matter of judgmentmine, as the observer. Take Quiddity (who signed up at page top for example) who once demonstrated a unbelievable tendency to pro-offer unwarranted judgments and unsolicited advice. Ultimately, I had to get firm with him and sent this, which he threatened to post, SO I DID. Nothing there to be ashamed of, you see. Bottom line... there are some people in this world that need rapped along side the ear to get their attention. There are others that need to have their toes stepped on, UNTIL THEY APOLOGIZE. Both those types benefit some by being jerked up by the shorthairs. Failing all else, it makes me feel better, and communicates at least one person, however crazy they may think me, has less than steller appreciation for their actions as they impact othersnormally others time. I really don't get excised much here about anything else. Endless editing and all that, after all.Sooooo, Thanks for the appeal to my vanity, but I suggest in the future you counsel people to examine whether a situation is ongoing, escalating, or one time episode of venting. I spent 2-1/2 years here acting as a mediator myself, and would never have considered involving myself in an isolated message based case. Not sensible. Call it justifiable road rage if you like—a real world situation here in cyber space, and  at least I cleaned up the vulgarity of what I had written in the first three drafts, to make my loathing judgment of his lazy rape of hundreds of pages plain. THAT is where I put my loyalty and focus. NOT on one of thousands of arguable interpretation of various guidelines and policies. If your INTERPRETATION of WP:CIV prohibits any colorful idiom or addressing a dumbshit-thing-to-do as a dumbshit act, I'm definitely done here. I'm floored that you haven't the imagination to understand that— save for the hyperbole about kicking ass, a deliberate attempt to indicate how poorly I viewed the 5-6 hours a day of well over six weeks of effort fixing his rape pogrom allegedly following guidelines — nor the fact that you were all being busy-bodies making much ado about nothing. One of the most reprehensible facts about contributing here is that there is a total insensitivity to the leisure time our contributors make, particularly by 'blithely accepting actions', one way or another, deleting their hard work and effort, which is about as personal an attack as one can make... Show me where NPA THE LEAST SENSITIVE to that VERY REAL, VERY PERSONAL virtual 'slap in the face'.  And fools wonder why we have editor retention rate problems! Wake the fuck up. THAT IS A REAL WORLD PROBLEM, not my slight episode of 'hitting' to administer a lesson in courtesy to others. (Call me twisted, but a single discourtesy to me  administered to make the point is properly due those who exercise the ultimate discourtesies, really without due process. Making 180 article pages into redirects without involving the community at large in the decision is to me, WP:BOLD applied way over the top. AFD or MFD should have been invoked, at the least. Not one talk page and three or four editors without a direct attempt to re-involve the originator of same articles, or their major contributors. BOTH THOSE badly need a quorum count provision, but I digress, the digression.) Those articles nearly 200 some were something apparently dozens put up... involving hundreds of man-hours and were well crafted. Oh, they needed some cites for a few fannish statements of cause and effect, but the necessity of that is itself doubtful in cultural articles about recently produced intellectual efforts. WP:AGF should be sufficient for such a report making a statement like """"this is the first (last) episode character/actor-so-and-so appeared in, and so forth. Then there's the whole joke of notability for such pages, which is hand"

Now that you've found a way to do it, it doesn't work the way I thought/hoped it would.

However, since Dr who1975 didn't but the brackets """"[["""" in, it won't translate to those preferences.  Furthermore, if the brackets were put in, then it would still sort alphabetically by what the preferences dictate — which again looks lousy.  Therefore, I suggest that we (i.e. you, Dr who1975, who knows how to do it (relatively) quickly) restore the old style of date formats.—Markles """

In this case Bishonen wanted Nina Green banned, and she was banned. That was not sufficient. With the decision signed, sealed,  and all but delivered, Bishonen pointed out that you had somehow neglected to include her proposal. Were you not aware of that? Had you not read the workshop and evidence pages? Had you not discussed which proposals to include? I thought that was the whole point of what you do. The ensuing unprecedented scramble to include Bishonen's proposal baffled edt sum the clerk and led to the present unfortunate epilogue.

At the beginning of this case the arbitration committee let it be known that the case was about Nina Green, despite LHvU's opening statement. In the middle of the case the secondary drafting arbitrator was happy to keep up the banter on Bishonen's talk page, but he and 15 other active arbs somehow failed to respond to Nina Green's direct question to the committee on the workshop page """"Is there any case against me which I have to meet?...What do the arbitrators feel they need to hear from me?""""

Roy, good questions. Yes it's actual thrust data from the Columbia mission, STS-107. However you can't directly measure thrust. Rather it's calculated from other parameters such as chamber pressure. Also the thrust curve is generally corrected to constant sea level or constant vacuum thrust. In actuality the physical thrust would be constantly changing, even if engine thrust was constant (which it's not for the SRBs). I include below some more info I was preparing to post:

Because of the frequent confusion on this point, I uploaded a thrust/time graph for the SRBs. I also revised the thrust numbers in the article to reflect this. SRB sea level liftoff thrust is 2.8 million pounds each. Each SSME produces 393,000 pounds sea level thrust at 104% power level. Thus the shuttle total liftoff thrust is: (393,000 * 3) + (2,800,000 * 2) = 6.779 million pounds force, or 3.075 million kgf, or 30.16 MN. Using these numbers the SRBs provide 82.6% of liftoff thrust. 

This is confusing because many sources just blindly copy the 3.3 million pound thrust number, some even erroneously adding """"sea level"""" or """"liftoff"""" thrust. There are six possible thrust numbers for the SRB:

 Sea level liftoff thrust
 Sea level peak thrust
 Sea level average thrust
 Vacuum liftoff thrust
 Vacuum peak thrust
 Vacuum average thrust

The problem is most references don't state which they are using. This is why references state SRB thrust from 2.65 million lbs (probably sea level average thrust) to 3.4 million lbs (probably vacuum peak thrust).

When comparing SRB thrust to, say, Saturn V F-1 engine thrust, you must consider the different characteristics of each engine type. The F-1 is not throttlable, so excluding altitude variations always produces the same thrust. At sea level this is 1.5298 million lbs per engine or 7.649 million lbs thrust total. By comparision the SRB thrust changes over the burn time (see chart). Space shuttle total sea level liftoff thrust is 6.779 million pounds force, or about 88.6% of the Saturn V.

In theory you could compare the SRB thrust at T+20 sec which is somewhat higher, but that wouldn't be liftoff thrust.  """

 @  You stated: """"Users do not get blocked for content disputes;"""" FYI: They do: WP:3RR You stated on the Bitcoin Talk Page: """"Users do not get blocked for content disputes;"""" FYI:They do: WP:3RRThe three-revert rule[edit]Shortcut:WP:3RREditors who engage in edit warring are liable to be BLOCKED from editing to prevent further disruption. While any edit warring may lead to sanctions, there is a bright-line rule called the three-revert rule (3RR), the violation of which often leads to a BLOCK.The three-revert rule states:An editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page—whether involving the same or different material—within a 24-hour period. An edit or a series of consecutive edits that undoes other editors' actions—whether in whole or in part—counts as a revert. Violations of the rule normally attract BLOCKS of at least 24 hours. Any appearance of gaming the system by reverting a fourth time just outside the 24-hour slot is likely to be treated as an edit-warring violation. See below for exemptions.A """"page"""" means any page on Wikipedia, including talk and project space. A """"revert"""" means any edit (or administrative action) that reverses the actions of other editors, in whole or in part, whether involving the same or different material. A series of consecutive saved revert edits by one user with no intervening edits by another user counts as one revert.The three-revert rule applies per person, not per account; reverts made by multiple accounts operated by one editor count together. Editors violating 3RR will usually be BLOCKED for 24 hours for a first incident. Even without a 3RR violation, an administrator may still act if they believe a user's behavior constitutes edit warring, and any user may report edit warring with or without 3RR being breached. The rule is not an entitlement to revert a page a specific number of times.
If an editor violates 3RR by mistake, they should reverse their own most recent reversion. Administrators may take this into account and decide not to BLOCK in such cases—for example if the user is not a habitual edit warrior and is genuinely trying to rectify their own mistake.""""  """

This is an oooold subject/section here, but I agree, the highly detailed diagram is quite scary-looking to a novice reader, and much more complicated than the basics of the topic. Start with something simpler, since there are certainly simpler aspects of diffraction than multislit-with-vectors. File:Wave Diffraction 4Lambda Slit.png would certainly be an improvement (simpler case, still a pretty picture that clearly illustrates some key ideas). I think that diagram would be even better if the barrier/slit were actually visible clearly rather than just another thin black line in a parallel field of black lines: consider either File:Difraction.png or File:Difrakce sterbina bodova.png. Somewhat related, seems like there is no navbox for the wave-phenomena articles. Having a directory of the reflection, refraction, diffraction, interferences, etc. main articles would be a great way to tie together all these pages and help students work through/among them.   20:14"

If this article isn't a commentary (and POV-driven indictment) on history, then there's the burden to prove that Shariah as practiced today also supports the kinds of restrictions on dhimma that the article claims it to. Sections discussing history should make it clear that their content is historical, and should not contrast events and policies practiced in the 8th or 10th century with standards we accept today. Sections dealing with contemporary usage of dhimma in countries that run under Shariah should make it clear what aspects of the dhimmi system are still being practiced.

Could you take a look at this colloquoy?
Do you concur that conflating Yakup with Yakub was original research?

Pop. (1900) 267,808; area, 6ooo sq. m. The strategic importance of this territory was recognized by the Romans, who defended it on the south by Trajans Wall, a double rampart, drawn from Constantza, on the Black Sea, to the Danube. In later times, it was utilized by Russians and Turks, as in the wars of 1828, 1854 and 1878, when it was finally wrested from Turkey. By the treaty of Berlin, in 1878, the Russians rewarded their Rumanian allies with this land of mountains, fens and barren steppes, peopled by Turks, Bulgarians, Tatars, Jews and other aliens; while, to add to the indignation of Rumania, they annexed instead the fertile country of Bessarabia, largely inhabited by Rumans. After 1880, however, the steady decrease of aliens, and,the development of the Black Sea ports, rendered the Dobrudja a source of prosperity to Rumania."

 Definition of witchcraft/Wicca 

I have some problems with this section. It's all very nice to be able to laugh and say """"you're wrong on all these points"""", but in fact this section is misrepresenting Wicca just as much as the Harry-haters.
The heading itself seems to imply that witchcraft and Wicca are synonymous. Wicca is merely one variety of modern witchcraft.
Wiccans commune with the dead and the spirit world. At Halloween (or Samhain), for example, we invite the spirits of our ancestors and deceased loved ones to return and share our warmth and companionship for an evening. Extensive spirit contact by Wiccans (via ouija board and channeling) is recounted in A Voice in the Forest by Jimahl diFiosa, an Alexandrian High Priest.
Sorcery: well, Wiccans definitely perform magic. The word 'sorcery' has a sinister sound to it, which perhaps doesn't fit with Wicca so well, but if it merely means 'performing magic', then certainly.
Occult symbology: this is merely a catch-all phrase for anything that looks a bit 'occult', isn't it? Well, Wicca is very definitely 'occultism', since it deals with magic and the hidden parts of reality. And yes, Wiccans use occult symbols, such as zodiacal signs.
Curses are of course forbidden in Wicca, as is all malicious or harmful magic.
Demon posession: Whoever accused Wiccans of practicing demon posession is pulling a swift one. Wiccans practice what could loosely be called """"posession"""": calling our God or Goddess into the body of a priest or priestess. I guess this is fairly similar to what Christians call """"being filled with the spirit"""", but if you happen to consider the Wiccan gods to be demons (and of course they're demons, aren't they, since any deity other than Jehovah is a demon), then you could term this """"demon possession"""", feeling only a tinge of guilt at your verbal chicanery.

The real reason why Harry Potter has nothing to do with Wicca is because Harry Potter is fantasy, presented in a manner that has virtually no resemblance to the reality of modern witchcraft, whether it be Wicca or any other variety. How many kids watch the Power Rangers and decide they want to enter law enforcement as a ranger when they grow up? The Texas Rangers, just like the Power Rangers, wear uniforms, fight bad guys, protect law and order, have headquarters and so on. The parallels are all there, but any rational person will immediately discern the vast differences.

I don't think we need to misrepresent our religion, simply because some people get the flutters whenever the words 'magic' or 'occult' are mentioned. Lets show a bit of backbone, rather than trying to turn our faith into what we think Christians want it to be! ★ """

 Virtue-based arguments

 Note that valid questions I asked in regards to my citations were never answered by the contributor Mihaiam, who is the only person who has repeatedly removed my addition - and yet I am the one accused of having my version enforced - when it is Mihaiam repeatedly removing my contributions.  The first sentence regarding the Copenhagen Interpretation was present before I made redactions to the article - and has also been repeatedly removed by Mihaiam - therefore it is not even my additions Mihaiam is insisting upon, it is his own version.  This is not consensus, it is Mihaiam insisting he be the only contributor.

I find it interesting that this first original sentence was removed by Mihaiam (that was not even my inclusion) along with the additional clause I included with solid citations and references (including links to other Wikipedia Pages with almost exact quotes) regarding the Von Neumann Interpretation - as an adjunct to the Copenhagen Intepretation - both of which are well established in Quantum Physics and is very much related to Quantum Entanglement.  The two Interpretations included are the most prominent Interpretations of the Measurement problem at this time, therefore Mihaiam specious argument that it provides undue weight is also a straw man argument.

Consensus means I also have a right to provide my contributions.  Currently I am blocked out from editing.  So what is next.  How does one enter fair arbitration where someone looks at the references and citation I have made in good faith and an equitable decision is made - not just Mihaiam who has not answered my repeated requests asking why he thought my references were invalid - which is not a free discussion or an attempt at achieving consensus in good faith (and yet I am being blamed here.)

These all seem to be reasonable solutions, if a little stop-gappy.  I think my problem is that I am seeing this as an outsider to this UK group and the UK group might be seeing the article as a group of insiders writing for insiders.  My initial problem with the article was that it is unclear and allows different incompatible readings.  """"Administrative geography"""" certainly makes the article more consistent, but I'm not sure it makes the title more understandable (unless, of course, you are a geographer or know all the branches of geography).  To benefit neophytes (perhaps I presume too much in thinking this is the intended audience of wikipedia and any other encyclopedia articles) on the subject which this article addresses, I would make the following suggestions.  1) Gut as much of the introduction as possible regarding the four countries and, instead, refer people to that article (since it already exists; which would also resolve some problems people have with repetition between these two articles.  2) Explain what """"administrative geography"""" addresses (e.g., national and local government hierarchies) and how this relates to this article.  3) For the love of God, rename (to whatever is appropriate) the section entitled """"In the UK"""" (or eliminate this title) because it serves no purpose whatsoeverperhaps to """"contemporary administration"""" or something that transitions from """"History""""; although for reasons beyond my comprehension, some people are apparently wedded till death to that vacuous phrase (i.e., In the UK).  4) Move the last paragraph of the Intro (beginning with """"Historically..."""") to the History section or exapnd on the themes it introduces. 5) Identify the referent of """"This structure"""" in the History section (i.e., answer the question, """"What structure?"""").  6) Follow strict style guidelines for the terms """"division[s]"""" and """"subdivision[s]"""" throughout this article if either is a significant concept for this article.  7) Incorporate the """"Parliamentary representation"""" section into the section preceding it.  This would give a structure of [Introduction], History, Contemporary Administration (or whatever), Informal (Sub)Divisions, International (Sub)Divisions. As things stand, having a separate section for informal divisions suggests the rest of the article is about formal divisions, which would be fine if the sections reflected a more transparent and sensible organization to the article currently lacking.

If I never questioned the statement that E3b is """"common"""" in Europe to begin with (although I did say the word was vague) it would indeed be odd if I then went on to say that the statement is extreme. How could something be vague be extreme? I also, to say it once more, do not question that the referenced source about Pakistan might indeed have said that """"E3b is common in Europe"""" though referring to what we can also read in articles about more specifically about Europe. So I am questioning the type of referencing in the Wikipedia of which this is a discussion page, which seems extreme. Nothing else. Please address that. I have also explained specifically why I think this. Please read what I wrote again and respond to what I really wrote? The way I understand it, an article on Pakistan is being used simply in order to justify the word """"common"""", whereas the articles about Europe, which both the Wikipedia article and the Pakistan E3b article must refer to, perhaps do not use that exact word, but rather give more detailed and less vague numbers and comments?

Born to parents, Jennifer and country music singer Grant Brennan, and having two older siblings, his family moved to Los Angeles in 1997. They lived there until late 1998, when Kyle's parents decided for a change, and moved to Sydney, Australia. Dane started school in 2001, attending a local public school. The family seemed to settle down in Australia with Kyle's father quitting the business. After Kyle's parents divorced in 2005, he and his mother lived in a small suburb south of Sydney, in the family home, which Jennifer's have left to her brother, who currantly resides there. In late 2005, Kyle (who prefers to be called Dane) did an interview in Nashville with Nancy Regan, a small town reporter in Tennesse. Dane was currently there with his father who was doing a comeback at the 2005 Country Music Awards. In the interview, Dane confessed that got teased a lot at school and the other kids made it tough. """"I am not gay, no where near it, and I nkow that for a fact"""" were some of the wrds Dane used. In the interview, Dane also stated that he did not want to go into """"the business"""" because he like it so much better in Australia where his father and family were left alone by media. 
  In late 2006 Dane's relationship with his father soured when his father married Alison Brennan. """"I hate her"""" Dane has been quoted as saying previously to the couples marriage.
  In early 2007 Dane become a first time Uncle, his nephew Leonardo, born May, suffered respiritury problems but the final word was he's """"doing fine now..."""" stated from Dane's sister in late 2007.
  In late 2007 Dane had a thumb operation for a rare benighn tumour in his thumb. In early 2008 it showed signs of returning. """"Yeah... it's being treated agin"""" Dane said after being spotted coming out from a specialist appointment in 2009.
  In mid 2008 Dane's brother, who had been in and out of jail for years prior, was hit by a car and was life threatening. He slowly recoved but it was nealy fatal. """"It was so scary... I couldn't believe this happened, his injuries were so bad"""" Dane stated a short time after the accident.
  In January 2009 Dane's father announed his wife and him were expecting triplets. Dane refused to comment on the situation but a source said that Dane has a nasty fight with Grant over the phone over the situiation. On February 2 2009, Alison and Grant lost a baby, making on twins on the way.
  What does the future hold for Kyle Brennan? In our interview, Dane has said that holiday to Europe is in the works and he's going to be and Uncle again.

 Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the city 

Dear Salvio and other administrators:

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2  and Chesdovi) are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag, that is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND  at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the   Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

Morton has made some alterations to his userpage that is in keeping with with the current policy, maybe a couple other areas could use some reduction in opinion. If this is the only userpage that details an editors major emphasis to the project, that would be news to me. If Morton wishes to demostrate on his userpage the articles he is glad to see deleted or the ones he thinks shjould be, there is no reason he can't. There is also no reaosn he can't provide, as a disclaimer, his major emphasis on this project to keep 9/11 conspiracy theory rhetoric minimized in accordance with the undue weight clause of NPOV.

Just for information, the Catholic Catechism on the Law:
http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3sect1chpt3.htm#art1

""""1968: The Law of the Gospel fulfills the commandments of the Law. The Lord's Sermon on the Mount, far from abolishing or devaluing the moral prescriptions of the Old Law, releases their hidden potential and has new demands arise from them: it reveals their entire divine and human truth. It does not add new external precepts, but proceeds to reform the heart, the root of human acts, where man chooses between the pure and the impure,22 where faith, hope, and charity are formed and with them the other virtues. The Gospel thus brings the Law to its fullness through imitation of the perfection of the heavenly Father, through forgiveness of enemies and prayer for persecutors, in emulation of the divine generosity.""""

""""1971: To the Lord's Sermon on the Mount it is fitting to add the moral catechesis of the apostolic teachings, such as Romans 12-15, 1 Corinthians 12-13, Colossians 3-4, Ephesians 4-5, etc. This doctrine hands on the Lord's teaching with the authority of the apostles, particularly in the presentation of the virtues that flow from faith in Christ and are animated by charity, the principal gift of the Holy Spirit. """"Let charity be genuine. . . . Love one another with brotherly affection. . . . Rejoice in your hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer. Contribute to the needs of the saints, practice hospitality.""""29 This catechesis also teaches us to deal with cases of conscience in the light of our relationship to Christ and to the Church.""""

""""1973: Besides its precepts, the New Law also includes the evangelical counsels. The traditional distinction between God's commandments and the evangelical counsels is drawn in relation to charity, the perfection of Christian life.

Hi Jkelly, In view of the problems I've experienced with attaching the incorrect description and licensing information when uploading images, I thought it best to ask for your help. I've received 2 images through email with the note below. How do I go about it. Please leave a note on my talk page (ignore the warning meant to scare off trolls). Thanks.  

Dear Paul

Thank you for your request to reproduce images from the permanent collection in the Johannesburg Art Gallery in on the Wikipedia site. Attached here are two jpegs of Boldini's Sir Lionel Phillips and Mancini's Portrait of Lady Phillips. Catalogue details follow below.

Collection Johannesburg Art Gallery

Antonio MANCINI (1852 - 1930)
Portrait of (Lady) Phillips
1909

Collection: Johannesburg Art Gallery

[Sir Phillips was not yet knighted when these portraits were painted, and their titles should appear in brackets]

Please note that:
1. The reproductions of the artwork should be acknowledged as follows:
Collection: Johannesburg Art Gallery
2. The right to reproduce is granted only for the request as outlined above, i.e. a single use of the image on the Wikipedia site. If you wish to reproduce the work for any purpose other than that agreed upon you would need to again seek permission from the Johannesburg Art Gallery.

This is the memo that I meant - by the way my German appears really,really, really bad - the German version appears to be copied from the USA version. Of course this is just one of
many memos between the participants. I note that the memos that you put
forward, however, seem to show that the """"Jewish problem"""" was being
handled in ways other than gas chambers - ie deportation or sterilization
( both rather extreme injustices but not deadly - a little reading
shows that Hitler, Himmler,etc... could be quite squimish about 
killing people (ie the wiki article """"Night and Fog"""" sugggests as much).
There has been attempts to question this memo's provenace, however, this
memo is just one of several that follow the same theme - """"leave the Jewish problem alone, at
least till the war is over"""". If there was any gassing - or any murder of 
Jews - it was being done behind Hitler's back ( and  the backs of any
loyal/ambitious Hitlerites ), a not very plausible scenario, but the one 
the memos would force on believers. 

The memo I meant was:

""""Mr Reich Minister Lammers informed me that the Führer had repeatedly
declared to him that he wants to hear that the Solution of the Jewish
Problem has been postponed until after the war is over. That being so,
the current discussions are of purely theoretical value, in Mr Reich
Minister Lammers' opinion. He will moreover take pains to ensure that,
whatever else happens, no fundamental decisions are taken without his
knowledge in consequence of a surprise briefing by any third party.""""
July 1942

Unless some scholar can find a memo dated after this that reverses the 
policy - and I believe all the memos and actions taken by various people 
(ie Himmler,Luther, Morgan, etc ) instead tend to confirm the policy - 
it appears that finding a memo with a Hitler ( ie official ) connection
to the Holocaust is just a dream. ( Irving's $1,000 - or whatever amount - seems safe) I hope this memo can make it into the article - ( he may have been a nasty guy but honestly he was 
probably just a bureaucrat, that seems to be the treatment he 
received after the war by people on the scene). 
Browsing/reading the German language wikipedia - I am not really a good
German reader but correct me if you are - version of this article it
appears they also avoid the relevant memo, but of course they have the
fear of prosecution over their heads. In America our reluctance, at least, isn't legal. 
Finding the Luther memo, it appears this memo is of an even later date. 
It is even more revealing as to what the policy toward Jews was during the war.
All Jews were to be expelled from Europe after the war was over - so it 
appears Hitler was not talking gas chambers,etc quite late in the war. 
Memos of this sort seem to crowd all the Holocaust gassing,etc into a
very small time frame - an impossibly small time frame, probably why the 
memos are ignored by all right thinking people.  

PS I just found out that the Luther memo has a long history. It has been ignored 
since at least the 1970s. I thought this was a relatively recent discovery
by scholars etc - it appears to just be an old unanswerable embarrasment 
to the Holocaust story. Thanks for pushing me to search harder. One of the troubles
with trying to hide or falsify history appears to be that it takes very little work
by very unknowledgeable people ( ie me )  to discover the truth. I found most of the
information that seems more plausible than the """"official"""" story by just hitting ENTER
on more than the the first page of search engine results.

A Nursing Model – Hildegard E. Peplau from Townsend, M. Essentials of Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing: Concepts of Care in Evidence-Based Practice. Chapter 1, 25-28. 6 ed. F.A. Davis Company. Philadelphia. 2014.

The referenced literature presents the Nursing Model of Peplau is based on an interpersonal theory structured on the nurse-client relationship development. Peplau created the Psychological tasks as a learning process which nurses could help their patients achieve personal maturity, since their illnesses have been caused by breaks or failed development during this process. The four Psychological tasks are learning to control others, learning to delay satisfaction, identifying oneself, and developing skills in participation. These stages are classified by age, childhood, following concepts developed by Freud and Sullivan. There are some important understandings about Peplau’s nursing model: Nursing is a human relationship, Psychodynamic nursing is a tool to oneself and other-selves development, and Rules are social establishments important to keep functional the social structure. As an example of nursing rules Peplau define social actors as a stranger, resource person, counselor, teacher, leader, technical expert and surrogate. These actors have an important function to improve the relationship between nurse and patient. The nursing-client relationship is oriented by four phases, Orientation, Identification, Exploitation and Resolution. The Peplau’s model provides the nurse as a facilitator of the process of the client development, where the professional - armed with the rules and techniques – interacts through relationship with the client to achieve a missed learning and maturing process.

In France and Belgium, there was a notable controversy at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century on the role of Masons in the establisment of a public school system. The idea was that since Masons were said to have played an important part in the founding of the Republic, the education system should allow a good deal of space for Masonic public educators. The educators were known as the Black Knights (Hussards noirs) because  their particular attire and devotion to secularist values. Conversely, all Catholic involvement in the education system was restricted or forbidden because of its seemingly religious character. This issue was for a long time at the forefront of difficult Church-State relations on the continent, and better access to private education was only granted in the 1980s after a long period of domination by the public sector. There were also similar issues in Mexico after the signing of the 1917 constitution."
0,"I think that the infobox should at least have a picture of Muhammad, if there is to be one anywhere.  The image for the page on Muhammad should be a depiction of Muhammad.  Having calligraphy or symbolism replace an actual picture would not be in the spirit of wikipedia.  Regrettably, it will offend some people, but that is not, nor should be, the impetus behind any decision.  A picture of Muhammad would be more encyclopedic and offer more knowledge, therefore, it is the only real option if this is to remain a truly neutral place to obtain knowledge.  Also, I feel like there is an overabundance of images in this article.  Lots of images of redundant or mildly irrelevant things, as if people are unconsciously putting in different images because they feel bad about putting in an image of Muhammad."

Dennis, I'd really love to hear an answer as to why my Coal edits are relevant here. I've stopped editing coal, and this consitutesDouble Jeopardy since I've already been punished for this and have done nothing since then.

It has little or no material"""") then afterwards, she began to follow me around to other philosophy pages, and reverting my work with dishonest comments in the edit summary given as reasons.

 Quit removing the """"status unclear"""" table, *please*.

 Recent rename to Relationships between American Jewish religious movements 

I don't understand why this article renamed. All of the major movements involved  Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform  have both international histories and a contemporary international presence. The current article content does unduly reflect an American point of view, but this can be fixed. Best,  
I did this because, after reading the page over several times, it only had US denominational connection. True we might all be aware that each of the denominations has an international counterpart - but that isn't reflected on this page, by its creator or subsequent, numerous editors. Of course if this was not the proper thing to do, it can be changed back...but the whole page would need to be heavily added to. It is a shame this couldn't be purged entirely and a new section added to the denomination page. Best wishes,  

Agreeing with Shirahadasha, I don't think it makes sense to limit this article to American movements. Better to fix the content, because the geographic limit is quite artificial. For instance, what about Israeli Orthodox commenting on American movements, or vice versa? We certainly don't want to have this """"relationships"""" topic segmented for UK and Germany and Hungary, because movements and individuals  constantly interact and comment across geographic boundaries. We need to revisit the title.  | Talk 

Before we worry about the world-wide perspective - which I agree would be interesting - perhaps we should focus first on getting a well sourced WP:NPOV article on the USA.  There is a huge amount of material on the US alone to sort through.   

Several problems. (1) Many sources and notable figures do not limit their remarks to a geographic denomination. Hence, when R. Feinstein or Joel Roth comment on other movements, they don't refer only to Jews and organizations within the US. (2) Accordingly, the current article's content is not limited to the US. (3) The discourse of the movements cannot be segregated geographically enough to justify segregated articles. For these reasons, I will would like to move it back and open the discussion here. Thanks.  | Talk 

There is plenty of material available (e.g. historical, socialogical, literary) that is indeed region specific.  This article hasn't even begun to scratch the surface of that material.
Why is it relevant that Joel Roth says things that are worldwide? If claim A applies to US and claim A applies to Israel, then A is appropriate in any of the following three articles: (a) an article on the US (b) an article on israel and (c) an article on the US and israel.
The material on other areas (e.g. israel) is volumous - Israel deserves its own article.
If we write a good article on the US and then start writing one on Israel, and while writing the one on israel notice that we need to reuse material, then we can always add a third article with the shared material.
Even if we need shared material (e.g. for Israel and the US) it does not change the fact that both countries have denominational relationships that are complex enough and sufficiently sourced to each need their own article.
Finally, its better to do a little well, then try to do too much and do it poorly.   

(outdent) The following aspects of the article are not limited to internal USA relationships:
 Haredi views of Modern Orthodox, generally 
 R. Feinstein on non-Orthodox Jews
 Haredia on """"heretical intent and the 1800s widespread denigration of religion.""""
 Modern Ortho on non-Orthodox generally
 R. Soloveitchik  not discussing American non-Ortho alone
 R. Lamm saying """"non-Orthodox rabbis and laypeople may possess spiritual dignity"""" etc
 R. Berger: """"The Jewish loyalties and observances of non-Orthodox Jews are decidedly better than nothing."""" etc
 Conservative views of Orthodox are not limited to American Orthodox, and general view is held by Masorti/Conservative too
 R. Schorsch: """"claimed that Orthodox organizations in Israel politically discriminate against non-Orthodox Jews"""" obviously not US
 The Reform section is not only USA, mostly historical

Whatever the motivation, 'altering' (that is, editing) a Wikipedia article by adding true content is an absolutely legitimate endeavor, hence deserving respect. Which reminds me of an old itch, the scandalous contrast between fact and opinion in this encyclopedia. In Wikipedia opinions (sustained by references, namely, by other's opinions) seem to be valued better than facts, an impression that is frequently reinforced by the language used in discussions like this one.

0,"Now even the discussion attempts to further contextualize and diminish the Red Army's crimes!  The Red Army's crimes remain crimes - there is always a context and a reason for any crime committed by anyone.  What Wehrmacht or SS soldiers did or did not do in no way justifies or sufficiently contextualizes-away rapes committed against women aged 8 (and lower) to 80+. Unfortunately that is what this article in its present form attempts to do. On top of that, this article about rape gives no voice to the raped and only offers voices of the perpetrators that dismiss the accusations.  It's rather perverse, misogynistic, and revisionist.  A more appropriate, balanced, and meaningful way to tackle this topic would be to give a straight-forward account of the wide-spread rapes/violence by the Red Army, including accounts from various Nazi|women/victims.  After that, background/context should be given to help understand why this happened, but never in a way that implies that crimes do not remain crimes.  In addition, a section on Soviet/Russian ways of interpreting/handling on the violence/rapes would be informative as well.  In its current form, this article does Wikipedia a disservice and is yet another example of a biased and amateurish account of history that cements Wikipedia's reputation as an unreliable source of information.  It is only by tackling these types of issues effectively that the Wikipedia community can prove it can be a viable source of information.  

Re:  profoundly a-historical suggestion.

Contextualizing the supposed crimes, as claimed by Udibi, is not the same thing as diminishing those acts of punishment inflicted on the Nazis for murdering 20,000,000 people.  I find his reference to SS Paramilitary as soldiers to be deeply disturbing, a-historical, ill-informed, and suspicious, as SS Paramilitaries were not soldiers and were not even part of the military.  While Nazi acts of genocide do not in themselves justify rape, they make it very understandable why people who assisted in the worst mass murder in history were punished by the surviving victims.  Related, the Nazis were very popular and had massive support from the population, who in turn offered no resistance to the Nazi regime; he who keeps silent consents; these women were therefore active supporters of the Holocaust.  It would not have been difficult for them to fight against the Nazis in some way, and they should not receive sympathy for not doing so and allowing 20,000,000 people to be murdered.  I really see no problem of revisionism here.  I recommend that other editors be very wary of this proposal to create a self proclaimed more appropriate, balanced, and meaningful way to tackle this topic as it may lead us to perpetuating the moral equivalency arguments of covert Holocaust deniers.

I think we also need to consider whether this is not just a case of hundreds of thousands of German women getting lucky with their liberators (a view shared by many Germans, described in The Fall of Berlin 1945) and then telling local Nazi leaders or Werewolf members that they were raped, in a regime where they could not openly have any sort of relationship with Russians.

I blieve the translation from the press office is very good. For someone who is not German this may not be clear, but the first paragraph states intentions, not facts. In Germany there are still people who physically hurt other people and (very few) state authorities who do not act against this, so I believe using is may be confusing. If you want to do a literal translation, the upper version is closer to the original, while the press office version is closer to the meaning.  

 Diverse errors and unencelopedic context use 

I would like to ask this whole article to be checked through. While most of it seems all right, there are passages that make no sense, lack imporatant information or are plain wrong. Examples: First paragraph of Drafting process is
The outbreak of the racial fanaticism in Germany cost humanity approximately 62 million people, or 2.5% of the world population. About 60% of all casualties were civilians, who died as a result of disease, starvation, genocide (in particular, the Holocaust), massacres; and aerial bombing.
While the numbers may or may not be correct, what is the purpose of this paragraph? The people who died and especially the people who did not die because of the war but because of the Holocaust are very important for the way to Grundgesetz was written. But there is no connection made. The next paragraph does not make reference to this and mentions the necessity to keep history from repeating itself in a much more neutral way. Later on:
Any war could and should be categorised as an """"atrocity"""" but the war that Nazi Germany started brought a scale of atrocity never previously known and the statistics of World War II clearly qualify it, by far, as the most heinous atrocity in all recorded history....
Unverified claim, clearly anti-German. The figures I heard suggest that both Stalin and Mao had a higher death toll than Nazi-Germany. Correct, most of their dead were in their own country, but I do not see how that would make it any better.
...and created thereby in Germany the legal situation within which any association of persons that, by reason of their aims or the behaviour of their members or adherents, seek to undermine or abolish this constitutional order is simply illegal, and which assigns to all Germans the absolute right and duty** to resist any person seeking to undermine or abolish this constitutional order, because this demand makes on the entire German people the memory of the 62 million casualties which brought the outbreak of the racial fanaticism in Hitler’s Germany.
While it is unclear where this text comes from, it does not seem to be a quote. I do not believe that this demand makes on the entire German people the memory of 62 million casualties is something that should be claimed in Wikipedia if it is not a direct or indirect quote of some political, moral or other authority. There is also context missing the the right and duty to resist. Violence by the people is only intended as a last resort and is illegal if there is functional police or military loyal to the consitution to deal with the situation.
Directly below the list with senseless emphasis, there is the claim that the German consitution contains blasphemy. Huh? The preamble contains a direct reference to god, other than that there is a rule that religion and state must not interfere in each others buisiness. I am not seeing any blasphemy there. At that time, Germany was a fairly religious state. To sum it up: I believe there was some editor here that wanted to make modern Germany look bad by applying non neutral wording and some unverified claims. The german version of this article seems much better and (logically) is checked much more often than this one. I suggest either having someone who not only read the whole Grundgesetz, but also has significant political and historical knowlege check this article for further inaccuracies or using the german version, which I believe is often checked by people who know the subject, to check this one through. There should be sources to every claim and despite the atrocities in the third reich, wording should be neutral and the crimes of the Nazis should only be mentioned in a context where it makes sense.

How territorial of you to undo all my wikilinks just so you could put them all back yourself. Some of them you didn't even put back right, hence the friendly notice left on your talk page; you still have some DAB links left. How is this clearer and who does that? Who will purposely undo what a previous editor didwhich actually helped the pagejust so they could micromanage a page and do it all over again themselves... but worse. I don't get it. I followed your dance-style-on-the-card rule and I added wikilinks which weren't there before. We were on the SAME SIDE Snow. We both want a better page. Pay attention. If you were thinking clearly instead of obsessing over a page you think belongs to you, all you would have had to do after I originally added the wikilinks is fix mambo, tango, b-boying, and kalinka (they all linked to disam pages). Then everything would have linked fine. Instead you undo everything I linked. Then you (re)add links all back and end up creating more disambiguation links than what existed before. You even linked to some pages which aren't even helpful. Example: you changed """"Tap dance"""" back to """"Tap dancing"""" and """"Krumping"""" back to """"Krump"""". The only reason why I changed the way the words ended in the first place was to provide a link directly to their respective articles instead of to the redirects (not because I'm being subjective). But you change the links back so that they point to the redirects. It's not like your helping people in their understanding. All you did was link those dance styles back to redirect pages instead of to the actual articles. How petty is that. Take Bollywood for another example. Are you aware of the fact that Bollywood dance redirects to Hindi dance songs? Not to mention the fact that there's also a big huge original research banner at the top of that article. How is this article going to help someone understand Bollywood dance better than the Dance in India article which is where I linked it to before you reverted my edit. If you really didn't like it pointing to that article you could have at least linked it to Bollywood#Bollywood song and dance this time. Either way, at least people reading those pages would understand the dance better than reading an article about Hindi dance songs which has very few citations. Stop being selfish and think about the readers.

Final thoughts
By-the-way, regardless of how the show presents street dance, """"old school"""" is two words and breaking will always be hip-hop dance considering it is one of the pillars of hip-hop culture. That's a fact and not subjective. Read a book, watch a documentary, or educate yourself some other way if you don't want to hear me out. I'm going to change """"old school"""" back to two words because it's good grammar. I'm also going to remove electric boogie, take African out of the jazz dance group, and fix all the disambiguation links you added. Then I'll either make pas de duex it's own row again or put lyrical hip-hop back beside hip-hop. Or maybe do both. Or maybe not even touch them. I haven't decided yet since you have a problem my editing except for the last option. I don't know what you would settle with. Any other changes I make won't be without good reason. I think I've demonstrated that by my long-winded response to your comments. If it kills you to see me make these edits again then go ahead and revert them.

Page Rebuild

For quite some time, the Alcoholism entry has provided out of date or incorrect information. I'm in the process of rewriting it to meet contemporary scientific standards for the disease. I welcome external review and discussion. 
 Stuart Gitlow MD (Chief, Annenberg Physician Training Program in Addictive Disease, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, NYC)

Thanks for your contributions so far.  You may be interested in creating a user account.  Some of the benefits are discussed at this page: Wikipedia:Why_create_an_account%3F  

It greatly reduces the chances people will revert your changes, for one thing. -)  

Good points, and I've created an account as you suggest. See my notes below as well. sg

In response to the commentary at the very, very bottom of this page (dupe social impacts), I've rearranged the content of the page a bit.  I believe that it now better reflects the chronology of how people are impacted by alcoholism, and therefore reflects the order in which this information becomes important to people: definition, effects, diagnoses, treatment, broader issues.

FYI, I renamed the first instance of Social Issues to read """"Societal Issues"""" and moved it into the broader issues area.  I moved the latter one up to become a subheading of the """"Effects"""" category.  After this edit I'm going to go remove the original note of this (because it's no longer germain), so you'll have to look at the next edit in order to read it.  

In looking over the article and the discussion of Stanton Peele's perspective et al, I'm wondering whether some of the ongoing discussion held on this page is about a misconception that alcoholism is equal to """"excessive drinking,"""" whatever that is. Alcoholism doesn't refer to someone who drinks a lot. Many people drink a great deal but aren't alcoholic. Conversely, many alcoholics don't drink very much at all compared against the general population's intake.  

The section on """"terminology"""" that you removed was intended to address exactly this misunderstanding.  Since you seem to think it's important, I'm putting it back in.  

righto 

Despite the difficulties that we've had of late, the entry is coming together nicely. I'm looking over the EFFECTS section, which has a good deal of information on alcohol itself, and the impact of alcohol USE. It is difficult to tease out the effects of alcoholism versus the effects of alcohol. The effects of alcoholism when an alcoholic is in recovery, for example, would be different from the effects of alcoholism while an individual is drinking on a daily basis. (This is similar, of course, to the situation with other diseases - the effects of diabetes when an individual has well-controlled blood glucoses are different from the effects of untreated diabetes). Nevertheless, I wonder whether the entire section would be more appropriately found in the alcohol article rather than here in the alcoholism article. Can we build a consensus regarding this area?  

 Alcoholism vs. Alcohol abuse 

The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism make a difference between one and the other. What I found more confusing is that from """"alcohol abuse"""" you're redirected to """"alcoholism"""".

""""Alcoholism, also known as 'alcohol dependence,' is a disease that includes four symptoms: craving, loss of control, physical dependence, and tolerance"""". 

Moreover, """"Alcohol abuse differs from alcoholism in that it does not include an extremely strong craving for alcohol, loss of control over drinking, or physical dependence"""", etc etc.

>> Getting the facts @ NIAAA

 

Response:  Good point.  From one interested perspective, AA literature itself discusses this issue and draws a clear distinction between alcohol abuse and alcoholism. 

I can't make the correction. I'm not that good informed and my english is quite lousy. Could you..?  

How about mentioning something about alcoholism as a form of drug addiction? Correct me if I'm wrong, but alcohol is certainly a hard drug, characterized by intense (and possibly fatal) withdrawals... isn't that addiction?

This is mostly true.  The root"

Actually, now that I look at that last page from the sanctuary again, it doesn't actually say that the owl in the picture identified as the Southern variety is Popo-chan, I just jumped to that conclusion. What's more, looking at the google translated version of the main page, near the top there's a section that says """"Here are the highlights"""", and one line in that section is translated by google (a better translation would be helpful) as """"intimidation, famous in Japan in the mimicry Owl Giant African Scops of Popo Chan"""". The link for """"Giant African Scops"""" gives the scientific name as Ptilopsis leucotis which refers to the Northern White-faced Owl, not the Southern, and since this link is right next to the link for Popo-chan, I assume that link must be intended to tell readers what kind of owl Popo-chan is. So, I think I'll have to move this info back to the Northern White-faced Owl after all.   """

 I understand your point. I will have to agree with you on renaming as well. From what I understand, it would be similar to what Current main Luftwaffe article has. A sub section representing Combat history in WWII. One might even add the other article of Organization of Luftwaffe in WWII as another section. 

   So How are we to go about getting this done ? As it is, all 3 articles have sufficient referenced information on their own. All we need is to put it together in a coherent fashion. 

P.S. I am sorry I was not able to see Archive section. I could only see the Page history.

Response to block on 2009-February-12

Tattle-telling
[ My talk page history] shows that a talkback was placed on my page on 13:26 for [ a comment that was posted on 13:25]. This shows that  manually placed the talkback in my talk page in order to call attention. He certainly doesn't want to make friends with me, so who is supposed to see it?

The block was enacted in haste
[ My block log] shows that the block was enacted at 14:08, whereas the complaint was posted to [ WP:WQA] at 14:46. Why would someone respond to a request from the future ??

Complaint to WP:WQA
Initial complaint
This may have been forum shopping, in response to a seemingly ignored plea. This is also about SarekOfVulcan's statements, which show bad faith overall. Blocking me first and then posting the complaint would amount to censorship, since I would only be able to refute the claims in my talk page, and through unblock requests. This risks my being blocked from my own talk page.

From [ oldid=270227244]:

""""lots of civility violations""""
Starts off using hyperbole

""""I'd honestly like him to settle down and become a productive member of Wikipedia""""
False statement; he worked diligently to get me blocked. Lack of """"useful contributions"""" cited as a reason for blocking, which is also false

""""if we can't defend our arguments against determined opposition, are they really any good?""""
Vague statement. I have agreed on some points in the talk page, while many others have gone undisputed. The other users seem to disagree with everything I say. Whatever is not disagreed never gets a response

""""I see him getting indef-blocked within the month. Can somebody ... point him in the right direction? Make sure you read all of the discussion, so he can't accuse you of only reading the scandalous parts""""
Defamation

""""has called other editors liars""""
A false inference

""""appealed a block on the grounds that, essentially, the Masons made Elonka block him.""""
Another false inference. He has cited unrelated sysop actions not involving him, in unusual detail, which shows malice or, at the least, stalking

""""Last night, I noticed that he had added a bunch of references to Daigo Umehara that included exlinks in the authorlink field, so I cleaned them up, removing only the authorlinks. """"
I never asked for his help, and he never suggested the change to me. Template:Cite web doesn't say that it's prohibited, simply that it doesn't work, which is usually OK. This means that his changes were not in good faith. He admits to following me to a page that I was working on, to do nothing but """"remove links."""" This is a form of harassment

Additions to the WQA complaint
In [ oldid=270230275] he added
Previous discussion here at archive 57.SarekOfVulcan (talk) 
which was a discussion irrelevant to the current situation.

Deletion of the WQA complaint
In  he saw it fit to completely delete the request, stating, """"blocked for two weeks: no action needed""""

From 
""""Was that in response to my WQA filed involving those two diffs? If not, I'll just remove it before anyone comments.""""
This is evidence tampering. Deleting it would be sensible, if one argues that his post is not even evidence.

In addition, he has described my posting to WP:ANI as """"amusing"""" in [ Blueboar's talk page] and [ MSJapan's talk page].

The article in question
Masonic conspiracy theories
It is part of the Freemasonry Wikiproject, and all of the editors are Freemasons. They have created a cabal to stop me from making what I believe to be neutral edits. Initially they have countered that the article as it stood was even more neutral, but have since rescinded from that position, and have taken to changing the article suddenly, after 5 months without a single edit. So much for a consensus, and so much for the article being neutral.

Many of my talking points remain undisputed, and have caused the other users to resort to"

0,"Losses and the Luftwaffe after the Battle of Britain 

In the 'Aftermath' section, it is noted:  In losses of aircraft and experienced aircrew, the battle was a blow from which the Luftwaffe never fully recovered. It had significantly fewer bombers at the start of Operation Barbarossa, some 929 machines, because of losses sustained over Britain.Bergström 2007, p. 129.

I am not sure if that is what Bergström, who is being referenced here, actually writes, as I do not have access to his books. I doubt it, however. The Luftwaffe frontline strenght certainly did not decrease as a result of the Battle of Britain, as reinforcements and production was more than sufficient to replace losses, and, to replace the existing types with more modern type of aircraft, withdrawing the older models (ie. by the start of Barbarossa, much of the 109E fleet was now replaced by the new 109F).

It is also contestable on grounds of Luftwaffe reported strenghts. Olaf Groehler, in 1975, for example reports the LW frontline strenght (not including a lot of aux. and non-combat oriented units) gives the LW strenght as 5298 on 11 April 1940 (before the Western Campaigns), of which 1356 were S-E fighters, 1711 being bombers and 414 being dive bombers. A day before Barbarossa, 21 June 1941, he reports 5599 aircraft, (ie. some 300 aircraft increase) including 1440 S-E fighters, another 263 in a new category, the night-fighters, 1511 bombers and 424 dive bombers. Therefore the claim that only 929 bombers were in the Luftwaffe (which I suspect is a misunderstanding of the original text) is wrong, as is the conclusion that this was due to some 'irreversible blow' suffered during the BoB. It may well be that 929 or so bombers were employed against Russia, while the others elsewhere in the West and in the Med. In any case, the claim that the BoB was some sort of a death blow to the LW lacks solid foundation. It certainly suffered considerable losses, as did the RAF which lost apprx. 100% of the fighter and bomber force it started the Battle with, but even in absolute terms those losses were not irrecoverable; the LW already lost about the same number of aircraft during the two months of the Battle of France as it did during the four months of the Battle of Britain; yet it was was capable of launching the BoB offensive just a month later, as it was capable of seizing complete air dominance over the Eastern front in 1941. Therefore I think that particular sentence is contenstable and should be removed."

Thanks for the reply. The Arbcom's ruling, to my reading, did not take a position on the issue of categorization. Categorization based on religion and sexual orientation are, quite rightly, singled out with additional criteria that do not apply to information in the text of an article. I think there is a serious question that remains as to whether membership in a house of worship, by itself, satisfies the """"public self-identification"""" requirement of the rule. This issue will very likely come up in other biographies of people from a variety of faiths. Categories, especially regarding religion and sexual orientation, are more than simple navigational tools, but can give undue weight to specific elements of a person's background.

0,"""Hi , I thought I'd drop a few notes on your talk page with some help on writing articles o)

First of all, it may be best for you to do a bit of reading, starting with the Wikipedia manual of style, which will give you a lot of information about how Wikipedia prefers its articles to be written.  It's not as hard to follow as it might look; quite a bit of the information there probably won't be vital for you at first.

Second, I recommend you make a user sandbox - which is just an area you can use to practise in, and to make notes in, and to get things ready in.  If you click this red link: user:/Sandbox, that will let you create that page (it gives you an edit window to start work in).  Anything, anywhere, on the help and information pages which gives you an example, try it out in your sandbox until you're familiar with it.

For your article, the next thing you want to do is start collecting as much information as you can about it.  Google searches (particularly in Books and Scholar) will be your best friend for this!  Once you've found the information, the next most important thing is to start writing up each fact in your own words (very important, this), and make a note at the same time of exactly where that information came from.  Build in the references as you go along; I'm going to copy in, down below this, a whole heap of help on doing references, which was produced by one of our best teachers ().

Here's another place that you'll find incredibly useful - citation templates which you can copy and paste into your sandbox, between  tags; you just fill in the blanks from your sources into the template, and you'll end up with nicely formatted inline citations o)  It all helps.  Remember to add a references section to your sandbox (make a new line, and put ==References== on it, and type {{reflist}} on the next line, so that you can see how your citations look as you do them.  Remember to save your page often! You don't want to lose your work.

Hopefully this will give you a good start and make life easier for you.

One last thing to keep as a motto: """"It's better to write one good, well-referenced, nicely-presented article than it is to create fifty unreferenced one-line stubs!""""  (talk …stalk!) 
How references work

 Simple references 

These require two parts;

a)
Chzz is 98 years old. """"The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 

He likes tea.  [http://www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com Tea website] 

b) A section called """"References"""" with the special code """"{{reflist}}"""";
== References ==
{{reflist}}

(an existing article is likely to already have one of these sections)

To see the result of that, please look at user:chzz/demo/simpleref. Edit it, and check the code; perhaps make a test page of your own, such as user:/reftest and try it out.

 Named references 

Chzz was born in 1837. 
""""The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 
 

Chzz lives in Footown.

Note that the second usage has a / (and no closing ref tag). This needs a reference section as above; please see user:chzz/demo/namedref to see the result.

 Citation templates 

You can put anything you like between  and , but using citation templates makes for a neat, consistent look;

Chzz has 37 Olympic medals.  {{Citation
 | last = Smith
 | first = John
 | title = Olympic medal winners of the 20th century
 | publication-date = 2001
 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]
 | page = 125
 | isbn = 0-521-37169-4
}}


Please see user:chzz/demo/citeref to see the result.

For more help and tips on that subject, see user:chzz/help/refs.

Ignore edit comments by non-academics with no names

A true encyclopedia is edited by professionals, with names and advanced degrees in the subject of each article. This is NOT true of Wikipedia. Any 8 yr old can edit, and should not. The current lot of """"users"""" works under a self-perpetuating back-patting system
that Jimbo Wales set up so that no-name people can feel important and also act as police over the less aggressive users.  The agressive ones get to be known and in time, are voted on to be admins and higher, where they can be cops even more so. Smacks strongly of the internal system of Scientology, the Gestapo, and the Salinist NKVD secret police. Ignore all the b*ll sh*t you read in the edit boxes under history. These petty people

An article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject. For example, discussion of isolated events, criticisms, or news reports about a subject may be verifiable and neutral, but still be disproportionate to their overall significance to the article topic. This is a concern especially in relation to recent events that may be in the news. Note that undue weight can be given in several ways, including, but not limited to, depth of detail, quantity of text, prominence of placement, and juxtaposition of statements.

1) """"It is simply a fact that many critics of Sarfatti are very negative about his theories and speculations.""""

False. You have not given even ONE valid example of that. I doubt you would be able to understand what the physics is about anyway.
You cannot produce even ONE objective valid refutation of any of my physics ideas by anyone. CH saying """"it's nonsense"""" is not objective. It's not valid. It is not rationally argued. No reasons are given. Also I retracted my FTL Communication Idea 15 years ago. Furthermore, making a mistake in physics does not make one into a crackpot! Also, you have suppressed the fact that I predicted the SUPERSOLID decades before it was discovered and before Tony Leggett, who gets the credit published his paper. George Chapline and David Finkelstein confirm that in writing and you have consistently deleted that important factual information from the article. That is hardly fair is it?

2) """"It is also a fact that Usenet is not the usual venue for publishing even highly unconventional ideas in physics.""""

Sez who? That is exactly what Usenet SHOULD be for! INSTANT WORLD WIDE COMMUNICATION OF IMPORTANT IDEAS NOT THE CRAP THAT MOST IDIOTS PUT ON IT. Peer review is a joke in physics today. Everyone in the field knows it. The free market place of ideas is supposed to be the Wiki idea, or am I wrong? Mainstream journals DO NOT PUBLISH UNCONVENTIONAL IDEAS! What planet are you on?

3) Sarfatti has been considered negatively by many since his involvment with paraphysics dating back to ths 1970s, long before the existince of Usenet, for which I have proveided reputable sources (and can provide more). 

STOP RIGHT THERE! You just committed a HATE CRIME! Are you ABOVE THE LAW? So working on paranormal stuff automatically makes one a crackpot? Is that your position? That's like saying it's OK to lynch niggers because they are less than human. Same idea. Think about it. Sarfatti thinking outside the box means he is not entitled to the same respect as someone taking the safe boring path through life. Who are your reputable sources? Show them. Martin Gardner? Show where his exact text justifies your false extrapolation. Also, I do not in 2005 hold to the same ideas I did in 1975! Why focus on 1975 and exclude 2005? 

4) It is also a fact that were it not for his provocative statements and the largely negative reaction to them, Sarfatti would not be in any way notable.

False. I would be notable for several ideas in physics. The quotations by David Finkelstein, Lenny Susskind, George Chapline and Tony Smith prove that. It's OK to say """"negative reaction"""", but it's not OK to LYNCH ME and DEFAME ME with putting """"crank"""" and """"crackpot"""" on a very scant article in such a way that that is the KEY MESSAGE the casual reader will go away from. Now ANY LAWYER will tell you you are treading on shaky ground if you do that and cannot prove your case should it ever go to court. This is NOT a threat. I am on several TV shows and I am in Paramount Pictures Star Trek. That does not make me notable. I am cited in several popular books. That also makes me notable. For example, Herbert Gold's book Bohemia, not to mention The Dancing Wu Li Master that I ghost wrote most of  for Gary Zukavand that sold a jillion copies and is still selling after 25 years. My original Space-Time and Beyond sold fairly well also. So look David E. Siegel from Two Independence Way Suite 100, Princeton NJ 08540, your research on me is pure shlock. It's fragmentary and it gives a completely distorted image of who I really am and what I really think and WHY I AM NOTABLE!

5)"""" Now, none of that means that his critics are correct. It is true that many well-known people are strogly attacked, and it is also true that many eventually widely acccepted scientific ideas are considered absurd and crankish early in their history.  (Continental drift comes to mind and there are many other examples.) It is possible (although I belive unlikely) that Sarfatti's ideas will be similarly respected in the future. (Of course that fact that many respected theories were once thought crankish does not alter the fact that most ideas thought crankish are always so regarded  the crank thory that proves correct is a rare beast.)""""

OK, THAT'S ENOUGH you SOB! I have several MAINSTREAM PAPERS of importance that are recognized. Details were systematically vandalized from the article. Prediction of the SUPERSOLID is a KEY ONE.

 Edit request from Jayjoanz, 14 February 2011 

Please add the following information to the """"Public Image"""" section of Lady Gaga's page:

Lady Gaga's public perception is always amongst the most controversial of topics in popular culture. Debate about her style and influence on youth stems from her unceasing desire to walk the thin line between daring and inappropriate. The pop stars ability to command the attention of her fans and critics is unmatched and with a growing list of hit records she has solidified herself as a marketable brand. Her 2.8 million Twitter followers and 5.2 million Facebook fans represent evidence of her ability to move product (Hampp, 2010). With opposing ideals about the negative or positive impact of her music, fashion, and public statements there is little question that the benefits of her talent outweigh the detriments. Her fan base and customer base are similar in nature because they are both drawn to her outspoken and outrageous personality (Hampp, 2010).

Works Cited
Hampp, Andrew. """"GAGA, OOOH LA LA: WHY THE LADY IS THE ULTIMATE SOCIAL CLIMBER."""" Advertising Age 81.8 (2010): 42. Communication & Mass Media Complete. EBSCO. Web. 13 Feb. 2011.

  

I think that section already basically says that.  Also, we don't list how many Twitter followers and Facebook followers a person has because there's no way to really verify that information  are those real people?  Are there any sockpuppet accounts?  Anyway, the article basically says all that already.   

 Drug-taking? 

Shouldn't something be said about her drug taking. She admitted it on her CBS 60 Minutes interview that she smokes A LOT of pot while writing music, while drinking whiskey. It's mentioned on other musician's articles, so why not here? 90.193.141.136  
I'm surprised her former cocaine habit isn't mentioned here as well, seeing as she's talked about it in multiple places now (60 Minutes, Vanity Fair). 128.163.242.6  

 Edit request from Cvachov, 18 February 2011 

1986–2004: Early life

Lady Gaga was born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, to an Italian American family, in New York City on March 28, 1986,[11] 

...in Yonkers. NY...

Yonkers is it's own city and not part of New York City, it is located in Westchester County, not one of the five boroughs. 

  

 Per the cited source, """"Birth Place: New York, NY."""" It does not state Yonkers. If you check the talk page history, you'll also see that this issue has been researched and discussed at end, and established consensus is that she was not born in Yonkers. —' (talk) 

 Early Management requested addition 

Frank Fredericks, a fellow freshman at NYU, recognized Stefani's talent when they competed against each other in a campus talent show.  Fredericks began managing Stefani in the Spring of 2005, booking her shows at the nearby club the Bitter End.  They worked together for over year, until she began working with producer Rob Fusari.

There are significant differences between being a lay person / lay leader / lay preacher / lay pastor, and being a 'pastor' within the Baptist church. The article should reflect the difference accurately by describing Mr Stanton as being amongst the laity.

This is correct. Tail packing and suballocation put multiple files into one block, but that is still discontigous from any other related information, like the inode block or directory listing. By contrast, NTFS stores data for *very* short (I don't have an exact number, but it's in the several hundred bytes region) files in the directory listing, which entirely eliminates a seek for the data.

 Dunnigan 

I assume the cryptic reference """"p.171, Dunnigan"""" refers to something by wargames designer(!)

This is not about arbitration because to be honest with you, I have passed that point.  I will be closing my account in Wiki and stop contributing because of certain actions by certain people.  

What I want to know is what would happen to an administrator who make it their mission to target a particular group of people and advocate the deletion of any articles related to that particular group regardless of the number of verifiable sources produced etc?

Can such administrator continue with such behaviour with no recourse or would there be an investigation and possible revokation of their title as administrator?

 IRWolfie's question 

Kozima wrote, """"The products of cold fusion phenomenon (CFP) observed by Miley et al. [Miley and Patterson 1996] are tabulated in Table C6.1"""". That table lists the kinds of atoms that Miley and Patterson reported finding in microspheres that had been used in a Patterson Power Cell. At the top of Kozima's page 148 he uses the abbreviation TNCF and he defines that term on page page 192 as """"trapped neutron catalyzed fusion"""".

Using TNCF to refer to the transmutation of nickel into copper seems appropriate because the nickel is being transmuted into a heavier element (copper) and that is an example of nuclear fusion. However, using TNCF to refer to the transmutation of nickel into lighter elements is a bit misleading because such transmutations are actually examples of nuclear fission, not fusion. In contrast, Miley has used the term """"fissfus"""" to describe the transmutation of nickel into a heavier element (copper) and lighter elements (chromium, manganese, iron, and cobalt). The term """"fissfus"""" is derived by combining the """"fiss"""" from fission with the """"fus"""" from fusion.   """

PROPOSED ADDITION:

Because interracial rape is now overwhelmingly black on white, it has become difficult to do research on it or to find relevant statistics. The FBI keeps very detailed national records on crime, but the way it presents rape data obscures the racial element rather than clarifies it. Dr. William Wilbanks, a criminologist at Florida International University, had to sift carefully through the data to find that in 1988 there were 9,406 cases of black-on-white rape and fewer than ten cases of white-on-black rape.

Partial consensus reached
This is Florida election night, so we really should enjoy ourself, and get on with improving this article. Therefor I would like to sum up what we have reached so far. As i see it we have concensus on most parts. Concensus meaning no one goes from the table happy, but nobody goes from the table with empty hands.
I have been bold and put in a new table, where I have incorporated much of what have been said in this discussion and other dicussions on the talkpage. Please read through this before undoing it.

Main Consencus: The table gets to stay, but it have to be changed

Lets go through the table colum by colum:
Date colum. Consensus: Days and years are gone to make it more elegant. Action: I have removed this from the colum
State colum. Consensus: No argument. Action: None
Type colum. Consensus: No argument. Action: I have removed the nonbinding/binding in caucus. It really couldnt explain the complex ways of the caucus. And it is redundant if the delegate count will be unbound/bound. Then everyone can see what kind of caucus it is anyway.
Delegates colum. Consensus: It have to change to something neater and easyer. Action: I have made two colums, unbound and bound. It is neater ) But more important. Personally I think it is the most important and educationel part of the table. So many comments on this talkpage shows that many have no idea what races actually gives delegates to the candidates and how many. Just read the discussions on the delegate count in the infobox. And the main tv channels dont help either. This will show how the delegates really are going.
Allocation colum. Consensus: No one in this dicussion, but on 3 other sections on this talkpage have been requesting it. Action: I have tried not to make it a tell-everything-in-depht colum as the old table have been accused to be. I have keept a very complex election cycle as simple as I could, without actually stating false fact. I feel this colum is important because in many ways this is new from the 2008 race. The complexity and the fact that many races are proportional means that a long race have a bigger chance of ending in a brokered convention. An fact that is important to educated about. And this can be seen out of this colum.
Winner, second and third colum. Consensus. Not yet reached. Action: I have kept them so far. And it is up to you all (me included) to figure out what to do.~
Source colum. Consensus: Get rid of it. Action: I have removed it. The references was mostly from the time of the """"schedule war"""" and 95% of those have been replaced with the reference at the end of the remarks in the top of the section (just above the table)

I might be wrong, but onless there is a strong consensus against the Bound and Unbound delegate colums, the only consensus left is about the Winner/second/third colum. No one gets everything (including me) but no one got nothing with this new table.
Now I have been bold, what do you say?    

I support the removal of the Winner, second and third colum. I don't see a reason to list X person as the winner in the infobox, then in this table, then in the subsequent table (immediately after), and then in each of the states own little blurbs on this page.

1) I didn't say """"one short sentence would be appropriate"""", I said """"so a small sentence on it is relevant"""".
 2) I accept that this point is correct, however, the article mentions that """"Creationist beliefs may be based on creationist theology, creation science, or a combination of both"""" therefore making this criticism completely relevant to the article. Equally, the further criticism of 'creation science' could be applied more widely to creationism as a whole. I am referring here to the sentence, """"Science uses the scientific method to systematically comprehend reality as it is, whereas 'creation science' begins with an assumption and attempts to find evidence or twist facts to support this original assumption.""""
3 )It is more a critical approach towards creationism, rather than simply 'creation science' that I am advocating. This article is misleading in that it appears to add totally equal merit to both creationism and evolution. While this may appear to be in the interests of NPOV, the reality is that the actual evidence for evolution is so hugely overwhelming, that to give an impression of equal validity is itself a bias point. Sorry, but the evidence for evolution is overwhelming, creationism is a pseudo-science of no real merit, and this should be quite clear in the article. I accept that an argument putting forward the 'credentials' of creationism is fair and should be included, but the argument against it should not be tamed in to give the ostensible appearance of neutrality.  17:38, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)"""

I'd just be placed in a mental hospital on a 72 hour hold, and that ain't no thang!  I chuckle, however, at the thought of a dishevelled cross dresser shambling into a police station reeking of BO and Mad Dog, Lubriderm and semen, and saying that someone threated to kill him.

 Light-emitting diode: the primary article, with references to other articles in the LED family; would include packaging and material from current Electrical polarity of LEDs
 Organic light-emitting diode: keep this separate since there seems to be a lot of good material here, although I haven't looked it over for redundancy
 LED circuit: the circuitry surrounding an LED (including material from LED power sources, Thermal management of high power LED, and LED as light sensor)
 LED physics: the internals of how LEDs function (including List of LED failure modes and Light extraction in LEDs)
 LED lighting: using LEDs to cast light on other objects (including material from Solid-state lighting and LED lamp)
 [LED stage lighting]] (keep as-is)
 LED beacon: using LEDs to call attention to an object (including material from LED anti-collision light, LED anchor light and Motorcycle LED Lighting)
 LED display: using LEDs to deliver information (e.g. status, images, video, text) (yes, there already is an LED display article, but it only covers video displays, which is overly specific given the broad title)
 LED art: self-explanatory (including material from Blinky (novelty) and LED Throwie)
 LED products: random LED-based products that I'm not sure fit elsewhere (e.g. LED Incapacitator, Individually Modulated LED, LED printer, DPL Therapy)

I'm least certain of the LED products page. I was thinking to gather together a set of LED-based products that (for the most part) don't really deserve their own articles. I'm no longer sure this is a useful path, though; perhaps these articles should just be improved in-place (or nominated for deletion). Thoughts?"

Remove
Removing some wiki links from """"External Links"""" section (These links are irrelevant to post-disco): a Hi-NRG link and Italo Disco link. In fact, Post-disco influenced italo-disco in beginnings, but italo-disco is other class music. Taking it all, Italo-disco link you can find in infobox, in """"Derivative forms"""" segment.   

 Dance-rock redirection 

I change the dance-rock redirection, from dance music to  [[Post-disco#Dance-Rock]] . From actual-point-of-view , Dance-Rock can not have its own article, because of its sources. Dance-Rock's only source is All Music Guide, so there can be a WP:V problem. Anyway, Google finds """"nothing"""" (only just irrelevant pages), except.. yes AMG and Last.fm. However, some remarking have page of Billboard magazine from 2004.

I also created Dance-Rock redirect.   

AllMusic source
This article is one of a number of music genre articles that were created solely using AllMusic as a source, and for which few other sources seemed to be available. I'd rather have just deleted it, but decided instead to trim and rephrase it so that it was perfectly clear that elevating the term """"post-disco"""" to genre status was apparently an attempt to fill a gap in AllMusic's taxonomy of genres, and that it was the creation of a now-uncredited individual author who was paid to write it. Also I wanted to show the author never really defined it as a musical style; it wasn't ever established how it was related to disco on one end and house music on the other.

Recently the article has been expanded to cite other mentions of """"post-disco"""". I'm fine with that, but I'm not convinced every use of the term was really intended to be interpreted as a genre name. I'm just afraid this article is doing the exact same thing the AllMusic blurb did: trying too hard to give traction to a name for something that really didn't have a name, or that perhaps was only called """"boogie"""". I feel like I'd rather see a section of the Boogie article devoted to the dance music genre than to continue down the road of searching for vague references to dance music in the post-disco era as evidence of an accepted genre name. —  
My opinion is that post-disco is also genre (""""boogie""""), but also a movement, but that's WP:POV. I don't know.. I mean I don't understand what's really """"post-disco"""" (after disco era / boogie genre ?) means at all. If it is """"era"""" so all tracks to present is """"post-disco"""", but if it is a genre... (unsourced; only AMG and some kind of sites like """" danceclassics.net"""" etc).   

 OR & source misrepresentation in lead: analysis 

None of the cited sources other than Allmusic suggest that """"post-disco"""" is a genre. Many of the citations are also WP:SPS.

The term post-disco (or simply boogie) has multiple meanings. Citation does not support the assertion that """"post-disco"""" has multiple meanings or that it is a term interchangeable with Boogie

Sometime after 1990,AMG was founded in 1991 —  an Allmusic editorial contributor used """"post-disco"""" in an attempt to isolate a dance music genre in the era between the indistinct """"end"""" of disco music and the equally indistinct emergence of house music. Proposition unsupported by a third party verifiable source, this is editorial analysis therefore WP:OR

Please any other admi coming here, do not remake the same mistake and give my smoke signals further to the rigth target: Tawker.
I dont care about being unblock, I do care about being treated as a person and been given acomment and else that outsiders dont mingle in a case that they do not know a single thing about.
Being reverted for not adering 100% to all mormons theories is in my view a direct attack to the first amendement.
Here are some proove for what I have advanced in some of my edits (I have edited from the 10th of june 2006 in the evening to the 14th of june 2006 in the afternoon, with being subject ton unfounded personal attacks and reverts without explainations from my first edits. Both from other editors (all mormons) and from administrators who were also mormons.
As you are not an administrator and not the one this edit VERY VISUALLY is adressed to, so you should have step away or contact the person himself to ask him to take a look here.
your actions in that case are counter productiv Pgk and waist my time and place in wikipedia. 
Try to bode for this or use it as a learning stuff for future times.
Do not make the mistake of using your previous type of experiences in vandalism as a stonehenge model for all situations.
Take into account the basis and what actually occured in the case at hand and that the people who generated personnals attacks against me did it without having been subject to such on my part, and only by assuming things about me who werent true.
Even when confronted with that fact they pursued their personal attacks in form of racism and accusing me of lying and calling me a troll, and all their edits stating those have not been removed nor do those editors have been sanctioned nor even warned.
Most probably because they appeal to mormon administrators to begin with.
I have written contributions in only 2 days, before all were reverted without explainations. That i was blocked on the basis of NPA is a cynical joke, as I thad tried for days to make the other editors to stop agressing me ´by answering my edits with personal attacks and to instead adrees the content of those edits.
I have in all my answers to them specifically and always adress the contain of their edits directly and accuratly, that it had contain also similarity with personal attacks has to be seen in the ligth that their edits were made of 90% of personal attacks and false allegations about my motives and source of informations, thought i had clearly stated what those were several times, and even was falsly citated on words and sentences I had never uttered!
The feeling of being done wrong was growing for each of those unfounded attacks, and instead of getting clear and founded and logical responses, I was confronted with further illigetimates handling as a pseudo archiving of the talk page where all edits, incl the 4 th last, had been removed, and the talk page was left blanck, and was officialy choosen to dont reply to my first edit, who was never adressed, meaning its contain and not me as a person.
The last edit written by me had been deleeted from the archive and the historic, which I didnt accept, as I know it was against wiki rules. No explainations nor warning were given nor the possibility to contact the admi who had done so as on his talk page he pretended to be on holyday until the end of june wich I found odd as he had done those actions a couple of hours ago.
Nobody being there to can talk that matter through with, nor any others being named to take over, and no plausible explanations being given for doing those hidden reverting of the page, I took the initiative to reinteger the last 4 edits in the actual empty talk page, as mean to pursue the communication and arrived at a propper reaction regarding the contain of my contribution and not personal attacks against me nor disuasiv terror actions being made against me.
I argued about it and explained my actions abundently both before I did it, and at the end of those, with a clear stand point concerning my worries about the freedom of expression being severely enfringe in wikipedia and the danger of letting this type of actions going on without control, as well as seeing wikipedia getting too onesided on a relevant amount of articles.

I hope this clarified some point and i didnt appreciate being bulled nor sanctioned by an admi who officially recognised not having read the edits he removed and reverted and archived, nor having read my explaination for reinserting some of those from the archive to the talk page, and also being warned and threatened and banned from an admi, the same, who didnt look at all at the contain"

0,"Incidentally, on p. 48 Alan says that another of the jurors at the Brincknell inquest was 'the subsequently more famous Ralph (or Raphael) Holinshed, Cecil's protege'.  Again, trying to impugn the jury's finding by claiming the jury was 'packed' with Oxford's supporters, Alan is in error.  If you go to the document itself on my webpage (KB 9/169, Part 1, 13), my transcript, taken from Alan's own transcript, shows that the juror's name is given in Latin as Randolphi Holynshedd, and Randolphi is not Latin for either Ralph or Raphael.  Alan knew full well that the juror's name was not Ralph or Raphael Holinshed, since Alan himself transcribed the report of the coroner's inquest.

Well, let's try again (one more time).
Re """"""""commonsenual"""" = WP:OR. Regardless of sui generis it has all the characteristics of belligerent occupation (Glantz et al.)"""" """"Commonsensual"""" is not OR. Occupation sensu stricto is something quite concrete, and it is regulated by various international conventions. For instance, Guggenheim lists three different forms of occupation, and one of them refers to something quite unique. Therefore, we can speak about the """"occupation sensu stricto"""" and """"occupation following an armistice"""". That is what I mean under """"commonsensual"""" occupation, and that is how a reader will understand it.
Re belligerent occupation, I do not deny the fact that some sources do describe it in this way; however, other sources (majority of sources) use different terminology. Therefore, the reference to one more source that uses the terminology you like does not change a picture much. I propose to present both viewpoints - you reject the very opportunity that a second viewpoint exists. Therefore, it is your arguments that do not hold water.
Re Malksoo, please, re-read his works again. And, since both you and I can draw different conclusions from different pieces of Malksoo's text, below is a quote from his own explanation of his own position, made specifically for us:
"""" The Baltic Sattes were occupied in June 1940 and annexed (incorporated) by the USSR in August 1940. Thus, both occupation and annexation DID happen. The fact of annexation - and that the USSR proceeded with its policies from the presumption that these territories were its own, not occupied - changed the nature of the occupation, if not in terms of law than at least in terms of political realities. For example, when 1980 Moscow olympic games took place, the olympic regatta took place in Tallinn. This cannot be a typical occupation situation.However, it is important that the article would make clear that in the eyes of the predominant Western opinion and post-1991 restored Baltic States themselves, the Soviet annexation remained illegal. In this sense, illegal annexation equals extended occupation and the whole debate is a pseudo-debate. The annexation - since it remained illegal - did not create any extra rights to the annexing power, the USSR. If the article makes that aspect clear, I would be perfectly fine with the title of the article being changed to """"Occupation and Annexation of the Baltic States"""". In fact, I would recommend such change because it takes more precisely (closer to the facts) into account the complex nature of the Soviet rule in the Baltic States.""""
What else do you need? Malksoo clearly says that in the case of the Baltic states both occupation and annexation took place, and we can speak about continued occupation in this sense (but not in others. P.S.) llegal annexation equals extended occupation. In other words, we can speak about occupation in a context of the state continuity of the Baltic states, and I never argued against that. Again, what synthesis you accuse me in?
Re """"there is no bridge between the Baltic and Soviet/official Russian positions; there is no in-between or continuum of scholarship, it's one or the other;"""" Wrong. There is a Baltic position, position of different foreign states (which was different from state to state and from time to time), positions of scholars (western, Baltic, Russian), Soviet positions (different during 1950s-70s and during Perestroika) and official Russian position.
Re """"From Glantz to Malksoo, a belligerent occupation."""" Glantz is an authoritative expert in the military aspects of the WWII, not in the legal aspects; Malskoo does not consider Soviet intervention in 1940 as a military operation at all. The only aggressive step, according to him, was a naval blockade.
Re """"Baltic citizens became a lower class as their homelands were """"colonized"""""""" Probably. However, other sources tell that the real economic and political situation in these republics were much better than in other parts of the USSR, hence extensive influx of migrants. Was it possible if they had a colonial status?

Mastic and gum arabic are indeed two very different substances, from different plants, with different properties and uses.

It is also used in vernice bianca, which would not work at all if someone tried to substitute mastic for the gum arabic. Mastic finds one of its uses in drying-oil type varnishes incorporating, for example, linseed oil. Mastic is not soluble in water; in fact, a small piece of it makes a long-lasting chewing gum.

Cu, I do not think it's so much a matter of translation as of using different recensions. All other things being equal we should use newer versions (though many contain commentaries so can be construed as secondary). But Bede seems to have been messed with over the years. Particularly, you'll find there appears to be a lacuna in all versions - Bede promises to return to """"the siege of Badon-hill, when they made no small slaughter of those enemies, about forty-four years after their arrival in England. But of this hereafter."""" And """"hereafter"""" never comes: what comes is the only loss of temporal sequence in the book. So this is why comprehensive secondary sources are needed. Anyhow, I am not going to try to impose some novel reading but on the other hand I accept that Martin of Tours was a soldier, Germanus led an army, Patrick's mission was accompanied by a Saxon fleet (Annals of Ulster) - I do not want to suppress this information in the service of an unrealistically sweetened picture of these Christian saints either. So this is why I am wary of the idea that those British bishops were dedicated to """"Romanism"""" - in fact the British invented all this """"Joseph of Arimathea"""" stuff purely in order to claim an apostolic succession that did NOT involve Rome. In this context I find it significant that David was made Archbishop in Jerusalem - and that this western Archbishopric has completely disappeared!   """

About pronunciation and writing of Asiatic lion / Singh in Hindi

It is pronounced and written in Hindi as:  """"Sa"""" with a small """"Ee"""" ki Matra before it, with a point on top suggesting half """"Na"""" and then full """"Ha. 

As in English you cant write the exact word, after English came they wrote the word as """"Singh"""", but Gujaratis in Gujarat write and pronounce it completely different, its a different language. They write it and pronounce it close to """"Sinnh"""", their Sinh means Asiatic Lion too but is not spelled as or written the same as Hindi.

 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan: Preamble 

It's already at wikisource:Constitution of the Kingdom of Afghanistan. Should I nominate it for deletion without redirect?   
 I just redirected to 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan; seems like the simplest solution.  Maybe some of them could be expanded one day if there was significant commentary on any portion of the constitution (a la Second Amendment). I know pretty much zero about Afghan law and doubt that they would realistically expanded, who knows though.   """

 Epidemiology 

There are two sets of figures, one for the population of people with mental illness (numbers ranging from 0.017% through to 10%) - there is then a set of 3 figures for the general population ranging from 0.4%-1.1% under the heading that """"within the general population the variation is less"""".

This statement is patently false - the fact that only 0.17% of the mentally ill population in one country have the disorder means that the variation between that and the 1% figure would be huge - statement should be removed.

Image Tagging Image:Sangesar(A H)1.jpg

 This media may be deleted.

Thanks for uploading Image:Sangesar(A H)1.jpg. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.

If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box.

I think it would be reasonable to delete the text below:

There is  contemporary Rubaiyat is by the Iranian poet SALAH AL-DIN IBN BIN DEEN called The Rubaiyat of SALAH AL-DIN IBN BIN DEEN This Rubaiyat uses a number of patterns ie AABA, AAAA. This Rubaiyat uses erotic images to explore a range of mystical experiences. The use of erotic imagery was  commonly used by Sufis in Sufi poetry. SALAH AL-DIN IBN BIN DEEN is well within this Sufi tradition 

Thy red flushed lips pouting moon-flower
Clutch the bee in thy humid bower
Entangled deep he cries for more
As thy wines nectar on him shower

Oh cup bearer bring thy wine don’t refrain
Up lift   thy porphyry cup that I may drain 
My lips to thy lips jar
Lips on cups rim I sip again and   again

Up turn thy cup cup bearer turns
Thy wine hotter than Karkhiya burns
The wine drips fromst thy hole like molten glass
It rim froths with bubbles in my lips churns

The text above may or may not be truthful in its claims of the Persian poet's existence; in any case the poet and translator are both non-notable as far as I can tell; the poetry, furthermore, is quite bad (at least in English; I don't know about the putative Persian), and the explanatory sentences don't inspire confidence in the writer's clarity of thought. The use was commonly used? Sufis used this technique in Sufi poetry?

Why not delete it all? If we do include it, the passage we quote from the new Rubaiyat should not be three times longer than our quotation from Fitzgerald's/Omar's.

Per wiki standards - when to use and external link:

 1) Is it proper in the context of the article (useful, tasteful, informative, factual, etc.)? 
 2) Is it a functional link, and likely to continue being a functional link? 
 3) Each link should be considered on its merits, using the following guidelines. As the number of external links in an article grows longer, assessment should become stricter. When in doubt about the appropriateness of adding new links, make a suggestion on the article's talkpage and discuss with other editors.

As a cook I often need to find recipes and their closely related variations in the same way a lawyer or doctor may need to find cases and their variations. 

In the past I resolved this need by asking the computer questions by means of submitting keywords. Today the method I use is quite different.

Today I find recipes and their variations by query - not by my query of the computer but by the computer's query of me. 

What makes this better is the time I save repeating keyword submissions  to refine responses and find the answer I need.

What makes this possible is the computers ability to minimize the number of questions it must ask.

Nateji77  

I would like to point out that WP:MUSIC only has to be met by 1 requirement. So even if you do not view the CDs released on Kidatrium and Mushroomcloud Records as """"Albums"""", the fact still remains that they (his band Sin Star) has been on 2 national tours. The remarks you made about the picture on the wall at school is churlish btw, VCU's center for the arts is very reputable for it's art galleries if you read the page on them here at wikipedia you'd know. Those tidibits you took cheap shots at were simply part of the biography, not claims to notability. The Music and the Web Design Company should be the deciding factors, and they DO meet the rules... So please reconsider. By all means message me back if you wish to discuss this.

Look the point summarized is I am willing to work with you guys on why these were deleted but until now noone has given us any feedback and has even lied about stuff trying to get it deleted. All 3 of them meet the sufficient amount of requirements for WP:MUSIC, the guidelines in WP:Criteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies, Wikipedia:Importance, Wikipedia:Notability (the fact that suicide girls, gidget gein, and marilyn manson are involved and can be verified in those links should proove that) , Wikipedia:Fame_and_importance mainly the part stating """"There is clear proof that a reasonable number of people are or were concurrently interested in the subject (eg. it is at least well-known in a community)"""" If you can't tell the community of Myspace.com and Livejournal.com alone are enough to meet this criterea you are blind. If you do google searches, go to forums and search their names, or visit internet archives you can find un-disputable information on the band from reputable sources, first hand accounts that are years older than these discussions, and intangible archives kept by internet archives. IF you want more detail read my above rant, your right I do sound mad about this, because I can't see how you can say they do not meet criterea or that this is a vanity page. Please accept my apologies for anything you have taken to be rude and please re-consider changing your vote. What Harm could it do ? BTW I am not trying to bully anyone, I can show you the location of the people threatening to come here and vandalize the hell out of Wikipedia. But I do not want that to be part of your decision at all. (please reference the large rebuttle on the discussion page itself)

I have posted this, I hope that some of you will consider looking for my information and reconsider your vote for now. A lot of people are simply responding to the rudeness of user:sin-thetik and some things I said are being misconstrude as threats. I am simply upset because of all the time it took to write these 3 articles, knowing they fit the guidelines, only to have somone delete them with the proof and verifiable facts right in front of them .. just their un-willingness to read them. Please think it over, I appreciate your time. I'm just a fan girl trying to be the first to get an article up about them since I have been running a fan site about them for almost 2 years now."""

0,"""Hi Paul

Given your previous edits of this article I'm wary of your neutrality here, but here's what I think about this

The 'controversy' section actually has several subsections.   Only the Jones section isn't broken into its own subsection  I guess you don't want to modify those for now.  I looked into the history and at one point it was called """"a controversial person"""" and was much different than its current incarnation.

The Jones subsection is overly long, but I would imagine this particular paragraph has gone through so many iterations that we can't deduce the original intention without looking at older editions.   For instance, the part about Paula buying a house and accruing a tax bill could have evolved beginning with a quote from Coulter calling Jones (her supposed ally) trailer trash.   From there someone may have objected to the quote, so someone else explained its context by saying Jones posed nude.   Then someone didn't want to look POV with regard to Jones so explained her behavior because of a huge tax bill, then someone explained that as a result of buying a house, etc etc.   Most actions in a persons life can be explained, partially, by circumstances out of their control, so explanations like this can go on for eternity.

The references to """"Oh Paula"""" probably developed similarly, with someone demanding citations.   If an evolutionary chipping away of coherency this did occur,  it isn't reasonable to wipe the section altogether.   I saw another reference on the talk page to the Vietnam section being originally quite short but gaining a life of its own as its context was wiped and arguments about it transformed it into something which probably has more weight than it deserves.

I'm sure LimpDaddy would object to this being objective, but the way I see it, the important parts of the Paula Jones section are
- Coulter wanting to """"bring down the president"""", no matter the best interests of her client/advisee 
- Coulter, a supposedly great lawyer, advising Jones to go forward on a case that was ultimately dismissed
- Coulter using Paula Jones then washing her hands of her once the dust settled (calling her """"trailer trash"""")

Additionally, the motives of the various authors are at odds, but reading it, the picture that emerges is of a very two-faced individual.  I'm sure some would say Coulter just learned the truth about Jones upon which she changed her tune, but that doesn't give Coulter nearly enough credit.

Though it doesn't matter for this section, you might see that the """"trailer-park trash"""" comment.   It is not satire or sarcasm to achieve comic effect, it is an honest to goodness insult.

We will learn that this universe is much more than anyone ever imagined, we will shed the """"god"""" myths of this world and know for the first time that humans are one of many species in this universe, not just our galaxy but the whole of the universe.  

The hate and war and injustices created by """"mans"""" religion will be over, the discovery will transport humans to another level never before imagined, technology will advance far beyond what we believed capable.  This will be a time of fear for many, losing ones """"god"""" and finding out that it was all man made will create those that refuse to move forward and experience the true meaning of our existance.  Many will try to impede our elevation to join the community of the universe and will try to attempt to demonize the truth and stop all of us from the truth.

 Hu12 administrator apparent libel and abuse 

Hello, this is a request to review an apparently libelous and abusive comment made about a living person at the talk page for Mount Hood, done by administrator Hu12.  Toward the bottom at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mount_Hood#Climbing_Records

The issue stems from, as you'll see in the article's history section, my interest in adding a simple climbing record listing for Dan Howitt, with the press article references.

Hu12's post:
After going through the """"google results"""" (a disturbing education of sorts), there appears to be a long line of aliases for Dan Howitt, posting over various websites and forums promoting himself and besmirching the characters of fellow climbers and related. Appears this is an attempt to use wikipedia to import offsite conflicts and further an adjenda. It has been removed. I'd suggest that Dan Howitt read the following, Wikipedia:Wikipedia is in the real world and Law Of Unintended ConsequencesHu12

My reply:
Please remove Hu12's Libel and Vandalism above and please report this user's abuse to Wikipedia administration. Also, Hu12 of the """"google results"""" you searched most are in support of Dan Howitt, with tons of his official summit photos on Rainier, Adams, Hood, Shasta, and listings of his timing officials. You strangely give weight to the abusive chat-site gossip and unsupported libel, and your own post above is of that nature. Chat-sites with this sort of conduct are sad.

An illegal alien who entered the United States without inspection, for example, would be strictly defined as an immigrant under the INA but is not a permanent resident alien.

 Explanation 

Hi, I thought I'd explain why the pages keep getting deleted. The long and short is that we're really not quite sure what you are trying to do. The pages are given extremely unwieldy titles that are written like sentences, which makes them an unlikely search term. The pages also didn't assert how Razin was notable. 

I think that you were likely trying to write about Stepan Razin, as he was part of the Solovetsky Monastery Uprising. However I don't see anything on his page to show that he was an artist. You commented somewhere that there were paintings of his on eBay, which makes it unlikely that these two Razins are the same person. It's possible, but extremely unlikely. I think that the Razin that's a painter is probably a far more recent person since a search for """"S Razin"""" (the name that comes up in the eBay auctions) shows that he's from the 21st century, not from the 1600s.

Damn, I'm not getting notified about these talk-page messages. Do you know how I switch email notifications on for such responses? Yes, I've done a lot of work there, but am tightly constrained in how much I can reveal regarding the sources of any so-called """"original research"""" material. Suffice it to say that I was privileged to work in the Dept of Physics at Auckland University (NZ), aged 19, as a research assistant (40+ years ago), where I made friends with a few young doctoral students, one of whom was researching gravitational waves. I then studied physics at the University of Canterbury, under Prof. Roy Kerr, the rotating black hole theorist. I've kept in touch with a few of those guys over the years, and they've introduced me to certain other """"big names"""" in physics. I bailed out of the academy before gaining a doctorate, preferring a broad interdisciplinary education, and disgusted by the stress, pressure, politics, and the close-minded arrogance of certain professional academics. I had a fun life instead, and followed my curiosity about gravitation, astrophysics and cosmology in a totally relaxed way. Over the past decade or so, I've been privy to hearing about some very exciting developments in theoretical physics, particularly with regards to the unification problem. I can't say too much, because *cough* Nobel *cough*. If, just saying, somebody (hypothetically) had actually nailed the spin-2 boson, but hadn't yet published anything until it's mathematically robust, peer-reviewed, etc, then it's (hypothetically) highly likely that the solution would involve a mathematical toolkit comprising complex dimensional analysis, multi-dimensional special & general relativity, loop quantum gravity, E8 Theory, etc. Just wildly speculating here, but it's the 100th anniversary of Einstein's publication of GR — could be a very big year for physics.

 Shrug. You can say that for any kingdom. The Germanic concept of a """"kingdom"""" is not a geographic area, it is a political area, defined by folks, not acres.

""""Lombards"""" are a folk. """"Italy"""" is an area, etc. The """"Kingdom of Germany"""" refers to the collection of barons in the area that once constituted the lands of the East Franks and their subject tribes (Swabians, Bavarians, Saxons, Thuringians, etc.), which by the 10th-11th C. is now settled down into large duchies (the royal duchy of Franconia, plus Swabia, Bavaria, Saxony, etc.).  This specific collection of barons acclaim their king, who is crowned in Aachen (usually) by the Archbishop of Mainz (almost always).

Exactly, Kelly knew what color her eyes were when she made the song """"Behind These Hazel Eyes"""". Comparing the pictures of Kelly and Belle, they do seem to share the same eye color just slightly different shades of it - Belle's eyes are little lighter. Someone made a video called """"Behind Belle's Hazel Eyes"""", the person who made this video knew what color Belle's eyes were and decided to include Belle's name in the title. And if you read the comments, the people fully agree her eyes are hazel with comments like """"green or hazel? they look more hazel than brown or green . yup belles﻿ eyes are deffinetely hazel problem solved"""". I like the """"problem solved"""" part. With Minotaurgirl's bias against the idea of Belle having hazel eyes, I think there will always be a problem with people like her involved.

TV Tropes has already suffered an edit war because of her, so much so they forbade users from writting what Belle's eye color is. Notice how Belle's name is missing from the Eye Color tropes colony, while the rest of Disney Princesses have their eye color mentioned. Belle's name was there under the category of Hazel Eyes until Minotaurgirl came along and ruined it all. Same thing almost happened to Disney Wiki. This is Minotaurgirl's account, as you can see she got blocked with an expiry time of infinite, the reason; inserting false information, the false information being writting down Belle's eyes as brown.] And now here's Minotaurgirl on the Wikipedia. Is there any repsite from her?

I noticed she has a Live Journal account. See what she has written. The lack of links speaks for itself. She thinks she actually proved Belle's eyes are brown, depsite the fact what she has presented as evidence is either a minority or a plain old lie, like the screenshots she send me. By magnifying the images, you can see her eyes are hazel-colored and not the same color as her hair at all. Notice how she's afriad to use close-ups of Belle's eye cuz she knows they'll appear hazel if she did so, thus disproving her. On her blog, she didn't mention that she was blocked on Disney Wiki, and said the only reason Disney Wiki kept Belle's eyes color as hazel was to shut up people who keep writting her eyes as hazel, when in reality the one who got shut up was Minotaurgirl as she got blocked while the others didn't. She wrote """"Bleh. Kids these days. This one needs a hobby. I'm tired of wasting time trying to undo this snot's damage, and I'm fairly sure the mods of these sites are too. Would it be possible to just...block this person off the internet entirely until they learn some manners?"""" Yup, she calls people who use logic and legitimate evidence to prove their point snots and hobby-less kids if the evidence goes against what Minotaurgirl said/believes.

If anyone deserves to be blocked, it's Minotaurgirl. If it wasn't for her bias, sites like like TV Tropes, Disney Wiki and the Wikipedia wouldn't have suffered an edit war about Belle's eye color. The fact that there was never an edit about Belle's eye color until Minotaurgirl came along, says a lot. Ever since she got blocked from Disney Wiki almost an year ago, no edit war about Belle's eye color happened there either. It's like Minotaurgirl is the only person on the entire internet who refuses to accept Belle's eyes as hazel and is willing to go to every page and change her eye color to brown, just cuz she likes to think so, not because the world thinks so or any legit evidence are presented. It's like someone going around changing Ariel's eyes from blue to green, just cuz he likes the idea of Ariel being green-eyed. Thinks don't work like that.

My overall opinion on Minotaurgurl. I think it's safe to say the interent is better off without her. She's toxic, she's a nuisance, she's talks trash to people just cuz they disagree with her, she lies, she mangles, twists and misrepresents other people's words, and she causes edit wars.

By checking his history and that of these pages you can see that he quickly and simply removes any criticism about either. His knowledge of wikipedia's rules seems to be extensive, but then why have they only edited pages relating to CAD? The nature of his edits, as it has been said, smacks of self interest. I really don't see the need for proving that he is who he is, but it is pretty obvious. For example, posting that he is Buckley on his user talk page will get you banned from the cad forums and Buckley's blog. I'll save you some time Tim, you've already banned this IP.  And this isn't hard to believe since he claims to make a living off income from his comic. For example, in this talk page he suggested that the fact that there are CAD gamer pictures available on xbox live. Those cost money, which means someone is making money. This is not article worthy and the thought of using wikipedia for free advertising would just be low. Ask people a million times to buy them on the cad site, but not here. When money is involved it's completely understandable for him to try and quell any criticism within his power, but this is wikipedia, not a fan site, and defiantly not a site to be edited by the creator of the comic. Leave this page to be edited by the rest of the world to edit. In conclusion, I believe there is an obvious user bias here. There is room for both praise and criticism on the page, if you can find good sources of either that is. Here is one thing I have noticed about the latest comic (although I fear it falls under original research and could not be posted): http://images.google.com/images?q=home+depot+shopper (fifth picture) and http://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com/comic.php?d=20080321 This confirms one thing I already knew: Tim uses blurred images copied hastily off of google image search for his backgrounds.

The world is not a fixed, solid array of objects, out there, for it cannot be fully separated from out perception of it. There is no absolute knowledge. And those who claim it, whether they are scientists or dogmatists open the door to tragedy. All information is imperfect. We have to treat it with humility. That is the human condition.” J Bronowski – The Ascent of Man

 RE: Academics  

The below section under """"Academics"""" as written:

It should be noted that Irvington High School was once not a school with high academic achievements. It has been said that the sole reason for Irvington's recent development in that category is the transfer of students from Weibel Elementary School. However, while it's obvious Weibel Elementary School has made a positive change on Irvington's test scores, Weibel Elementary School is only a small portion of Irvington's students. A much greater possibility is that students from other schools served as examples, and the inspiration was enough to raise Irvington's academic achievement. 

The above passaage is bias and speculative, and should warrant a citation. Student from Weibel Elementary School do not, nor cannot feed directly into Irvington High School. As is the case in any public school system in the United States, unless a student is gifted, elementry school students matriculate into a junior high or middle school, than they move onto high school. 

I recommend that this whole section be stricken. I attended Irvington High School in the early 1990's and the differnece between the Weible neighborhood of Fremont and Irvington disctrict is very little. Both are middle to upper middle class, with the housing tracks in Weibel being slightly newer than the older housing track of Irvington district. While the Weibel neighborhood benefited from the high tax revenues of other parts of mission san jose district, very little seperates the two area other than a larger working class population in the Irvington district as a result of the pre-silcon valley economies in which many autoworkers from Genreal Motors in Fremont, Peterbuilt, Trail Mobile, and Caterpillar in Newark,Ca, and Ford Motors in Milpitas,CA resided in the Irvington district. However, as Unionized laborers these workers made a good wage for the time, maybe as well of a living as those currently in the Weibel neighborhood given inflation and cost of living in California of the 1970's and 1980's. 

If this section should stay it should speak rather to the major re-organzation that took place in the middle to late 90's under the leadership of Principal Gaskill and Vice-Principal (current Principal) Pete Murchison (check spelling). As all of the accolades currently enjoyed by IHS were earned prior the the FUSD reorganization which placed the Weibel neighborhood  in the IHS service area. This can easily be verifyed by crossing the early state-wide and national honors Irvington High School earned in the mid-1990's. Thus, de-bunking the assertion that Weibel neighborhood elemtry school students are responsible for the academic excellence of IHS."""

But I may call Wikipedia your propaganda tool, since you are apparently the one who has been granted authority to tolerate certain comments which you interpret as being unbiased and to crassly delete other information which you interpret as being biased.  If you really want to avoid bias, just casually investigate the history of your pornography supporting friend Horrorshow, who, not surprisingly, has been busy editing other articles that clearly promote the pornography industry.  Wikipedia: a free speech tool for the people or a propaganda tool for a certain sector of the population which seeks to control people's opinions on matters that adversely affect their mental health?  Quite a question to ponder.  But my point on bias is that every author is biased.  Just because Wikipedia can be edited by supposedly anybody (in theory it can be, but in reality it is clearly controlled by certain well-organized individuals who have made Wikipediaing their vocations), does not make Wikipedia an unbiased source of information.  The author of this webpage, who clearly has an interest in displaying information that promotes the pornography industry in the United States, is biased.

""""List of cities by surface area"""" matches that, except that it mentions """"Juneau City and Borough"""".

The pages about those four individual cities today have figures that match, too. Yet, when I posted in this section several days ago, the article on Jacksonville said 1,962.4 square miles.

Jacksonville's own government website says it has 841 square miles, not 874 or 758.

I'm not sure whether some people or governments are rightly or wrongly putting all of a county's land into the city's listed area. I can say that, in the case of Jacksonville, although the governments of the (a) City of Jacksonville and (b) Duval County are unified, there is (or ought to be) separate reckoning of the city's and county's area, because Duval County also contains three other cities (Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach, and Neptune Beach), which are not part of the City of Jacksonville (they have their own, separate police departments, for example—even though the Jacksonville Public Library is county-wide).

The government website of the City and Borough of Juneau says it has 2,593.6 square miles of land and 487.6 square miles of water, for a total of 3,081.2 square miles. Neither the total nor the land area there matches what Wikipedia gives.

At the government website of the City and Borough of Sitka, I haven't found the area.

Same for the government website of Anchorage. But it does link to anchorage.net, which says the city has 1,955 square miles—which, like the government figures for Jacksonville and Juneau, doesn't match Wikipedia's figure.

The Cherokee comment was a concern because JVM stated, as if it were established fact, that the person he was talking about had attempted witness tampering, extortion, and solicitation of murder.

I don't think murder-for-hire, extortion, or witness tampering would be treated so lightly by federal and state prosecutors; in one sentence JVM claims that the plot was uncovered during the trial and just a couple of diffs later he claims that he was involved in arranging a deal resulting in only a permanent injunction against selling peyote.

I'm sorry if my post read as an attack. I was not attacking COgden personally, only the confusing discrepancy of his doctrinal position.

 Recent page moves (see also: unresolved discussion above regarding this issue) 
OK  I don't understand why this is an issue, unless you all figure that this article deserves some sort-of 'special exception' to Wikipedia's rules of article naming and precedent. If so inclined, click: French Jews, German Jews, Russian Jews, and so forth on in to perpetuity. ALL of these names REDIRECT to the """"History of the Jews in [country]"""" articles, i.e. they DO NOT have their own special article on this topic (even though, for whatever reason, THIS page on """"Jews and Judaism in the United States"""" IS indeed a separate entity from the """"History of the Jews in the United States"""" page, not to mention separate from the Lists of American Jews [also wrong titled, differs from category name], and separate from Category:Jewish Americans [correct category name]). DO YOU ALL NOW SEE WHAT A COMPLETE AND UTTER MESS YOU HAVE MADE OF THESE JEWS AND JUDAISM RELATED AMERICAN ARTICLES AND CATEGORIES because of all of the wayward and entirely unneeded article/category moves and counter-moves, renames and counter-renames?  I merely seek to fix (standardize) all of this, nothing more.  Please help me to do this, and please stop engaging in these senseless/childish edit wars and continuing to revert and/or disregard my good moves and valid information.

There are many article/category naming irregularities still out there (found in Judaism by country [maybe we start there?] such as Italian Jews, but I'm about to fix that), but we need to stick to ONE naming scheme for ALL Jewish articles, and so far the category naming scheme """"Jews and Judaism in [country]"""" (as opposed to """"History of the Jews in [country]"""") is the most widespread and used, thus it can be regarded as a precedent (or is one used for the category, one for the actual article?). The confusing part is that, like I just hinted at, in some cases we have """"History of the Jews in [country]"""" pages, along with """"Jews and Judaism in [country]"""" pages (plus tons of categories with same name, which User:IZAK has been standardizing to some extent), along with the list articles like List of German Jews, List of British Jews, and so forth. So, maybe we need to start a discussion and approve a policy of article name STANDARDIZATION and PRECEDENT than can be followed in the future as they relate to ALL of these disparate yet related pages (Jews/Judaism in [country], History of Jews in [country], List of [national] Jews, all related to the standard category naming scheme """"Jews and Judaism in [country]""""). Per User:IZAK's recent moves involving the Swiss and Norwegian Jew articles I thought that this was and has been the accepted norm/precedent, but now I am being reverted for moving this article to its similar name, yet of course no one objects to IZAK's moves at all. If I am doing something wrong here, by all means please let me know  however, I am just trying to improve the overall naming and organizational scheme of this article and indeed all of the Category:Jews and Judaism by country (Judaism by country) articles/categories as a whole.

Also...Jayjg, why do you keep reverting the List of Jewish Americans to List of American Jews even though ALL of the actual lists found in that master list are still named """"List of Jewish American [profession]"""" as they should be, a hold-over from the olden days when these article/category names weren't in such a state of disorganization and disarray?

It is hard to find a """"neutral"""" reference about Scientology.

There are sources in the media like Richard Lieby (now at the Wash Post) that have written numerous newspaper articles exposing the cult.  There has been an article in Time Magazine about the cult that was reprinted in Readers' Digest.  60 Minutes has done a couple of exposes on the cult as well, but none of these have been flattering for Scientology.   The task you are expecting is akin to asking someone looking into the pit of hell and write a neutral non-POV article about Satan incarnate.  Unfortunately, it just isn't possible.   

There is a page that purports to be a neutral resource at [Bernie's Scientology Pages], but even a cursory examination of his site shows that 99% of his words and pages are either criticizing critics of Scientology or making excuses for the Church of Scientology.

 Kickstart disks 

The current article states 'subsequent Amiga models all used ROM chips' [following the A1000] in relation to Kickstart.

However, I remember that the Amiga 3000 also required such a Kickstart disk. Can anyone confirm? Thanks!

Most A3000s used ROMs, but some (like mine) had a small """"Super Kickstart"""" in ROM which read Kickstart from floppy or hard disk. (Super Kickstart was based on AmigaOS 1.4, which never appeared anywhere else.) IIRC, only the machines manufactured in Europe had """"Super Kickstart"""", but I may well be wrong on that detail. I do know that I never got my machine to boot a v3.x AmigaOS =(. Cheers, (talk) 

 Freeing memory 

(This is relevant to a different Wikipedia article). I have the statement in front of me that, when a program terminates in AmigaOS, memory assigned by the program is not freed, and that it is therefore vital for the program to release all memory that it asked for, otherwise it is permanently """"leaked"""". Is this the case?  

Memory that is not freed before termination of a program in the Amiga OS is leaked (assuming it was supposed to be freed - in some cases a program may have allocated structures and attached them to system objects, such as a device node).  One of the most common modes of testing on the Amiga was checking free memory after program exit; there were many tools that automated that.  Normal behavior of a program was to free all memory, and all malloc'd memory was automatically freed via exit-time hooks.  (I.e. leaking memory typically only happened to memory obtained via AllocMem() and the like.)   

Indeed. AmigaOS does little to no resource tracking in order to save the memory overhead that it costs to include tracking. There was also a third-party program that patched many allocate/free resource functions (e.g. AllocMem/FreeMem, OpenWindow/CloseWindow) and added resource tracking to them, however this would break any software that deliberately allocate memory then exited, for example programs which installed patches on system functions. Programs assume the responsibility for freeing all allocated memory. The standard C library implementation in most Amiga C compilers used an onexit handler that freed any memory allocated with the malloc() implementation, but if the program crashed or the AmigaOS memory allocation routines were called directly, memory allocations were not freed. Other languages had varying degrees of support for tracking memory, usually (like C) only if you used the language-specific memory allocators.  

Thank you for your replies. The reason for the question relates to a discussion I've been having on memory leak. I'm going to post a question which is very subjective, but maybe there's a consensus. The article includes """"In modern operating systems, normal memory used by an application is released when the application terminates"""". Part of the debate is over whether this is really true, and whether it should say """"In some operating systems..."""". The leading question is: is AmigaOS a """"modern operating system""""? A supplementary dispute, where it says """"The application assumes that the request for memory has succeeded, and continues on this basis. This will typically result in an access violation but in some cases may result in damaging information belonging to this or (in primitive systems) some other application."""" Should this have """"some systems"""" in place of """"primitive systems""""? Thanks in advance.  

The amiga would be included in """"modern operating systems"""", and it does release """"normal memory"""" (i.e. malloced) when the application ends.  Program crashes on an Amiga do not release memory, so you could say it leaks on process crash.  And a program that uses things like OpenFile() instead of open() will leak a filehandle (and some memory) if the program calls exit() without closing the file.  As for your second question, the answer would be """"some systems"""" - many """"modern"""" embedded systems (including running unix variants like uclinux) do not have memory protection, and can read (and possibly write) structures using NULL as a pointer without an access violation.  Personally, I HATE programs that don't check malloc (or any other calls) for failure.  Good programming practice on the Amiga (due to the lack of VM) was to test programs and the OS against random memory allocation failures to see if they recovered cleanly or not.  All allocations (and all system calls, etc) should be checked for failure and"

(deindent) Not even wrong only if you don't understand what he's doing. These are all standard problems for the many millions of people who have tried to make sense of infinite arithmetic at some point in their lives.

The number  ...9997 in Archimedes' system is also known as the number -3, which almost is the """"largest prime"""" in Ludwig's order on the Plutonian integers. You would think ...99998 might be the right one, but that's -2, and it is clearly divisible by two. So maybe ...9997 should be thought of as divisible by three, but dividing by three is different than dividing by two in base-10, because two divides 10 and three does not. So maybe that's a self-consistent definition in a 10-based infinite arithmetic with the order he chooses. Maybe not. I don't know, but neither do you, and to pretend otherwise is insincere. It's not incoherent, just original, and incomplete. The methodology is obviously many, many, painstaking infinite digit calculations, with the extra burden that the rules keep shifting whenever he finds an inconsistency. 

The reason he claims transcendental numbers are incomplete is because, if you accept that the integers are Plutonian, the real numbers are only """"finitely"""" wide. Normally, a real number can be thought of as a map from Z->digits, giving it's digit sequence. Unfortunately, Plutonium's """"Z"""" is just as large as the real numbers, so that a real number is really only a sequence of digits, because a sequence in this view cannot be viewed as a map from Z-> digits. In this view Z is larger than any sequence (the integers are """"uncountable""""). So the real numbers have """"gaps"""" which would be filled by reciprocals of infinite integers. But large integers don't have reciprocals in Plutonium's system, because he can't make any sense out of bi-infinite sequences:

Numbers like ... 999123.3333..... are not allowed because you can't do multiplication digit by digit.

So he doesn't think of the real numbers as containing the integers, he has two classes of numbers the """"Adic integers"""" which are infinite to the left and finite to the right, and the """"real numbers"""" which are infinite to the right and finite to the left, and it is illegal to add an adic integer and a real number.

The reason Archimedes Plutonium keeps working on the Riemann Hypothesis is because he feels he can say something new about the distribution of primes because he has knowledge of some infinite ones. This is because he can ask questions like """"if I choose an infinite integer at random, digit by digit, do I get a prime number?"""" Those sorts of questions have analytic counterparts about real numbers (complete numbers really). He probably feels the twin-prime conjecture is false, becuase, what's the chance that the infinite integer ....321113 and ....321115 are both prime? He also probably feels that an infinite even number can never be the sum of two primes. These last two statements are both based on my own thinking. He might thinks that there are very many primes at infinity, I don't know for sure.

Look, I am not saying his mathematical musing are not cranckish. But recognize that Archimedes Plutonium is to cranck science as Isaac Newton is to mainstream science. He has seen futher than others even though he stands on the shoulders of no-one. """

The following excerpt is just one example of Wikipedia guidelines which have been willfully, persistently and openly ignored and defied by Wikipedia editor after Wikipedia editor.

Privacy of names

Caution should be applied when naming individuals who are discussed primarily in terms of a single event. When the name of a private individual has not been widely disseminated or has been intentionally concealed (such as in certain court cases), it is often preferable to omit it, especially when doing so does not result in a significant loss of context. When evaluating the inclusion or removal of names, their publication in secondary sources other than news media, such as scholarly journals or the work of recognized experts, should be afforded greater weight than the brief appearance of names in news stories.

Editors should take particular care when considering whether inclusion of the names of private, living individuals who are not directly involved in an article's topic adds significant value. The presumption in favor of the privacy of family members of articles' subjects and other loosely involved persons without independent notability is correspondingly stronger."

This is untrue.  I have not been blocked for the reasons mentioned but rather for entirely different reasons, since the reasons mentioned are not actually true.  It is impossible to """"exhibit a battleground attitude"""" because of many reasons, including the fact that one cannot """"exhibit"""" something unless one is a display engineer at a museum, and it would therefore be impossible to """"exhibit"""" anything let alone a """"battleground attitude,"""" the fact that there is no such thing as a """"battleground attitude,"""" the fact that there is no such thing as an """"attitude"""" in regards to how a human being acts, and the fact that the word """"exhibit"""" is used in an incorrect manner here done solely for the purpose of antagonizing the user (antagonizing me).  Usage of words like """"exhibit"""" and """"attitude"""", and refusing to follow the section title requirements on my page, show an obvious malfeasance intent by the above person, and therefore the block cannot be valid because within the first sentence he has already seriously demonstrated his lack of appropriate intent by specifically and purposefully being antagonizing.  

The second claim is physically possible, but is blatantly false.  I have specifically attempted to PREVENT other users from refusing to communicate in a appropriate manner, as he was repeatedly replying to the same conversation in several different locations, for which I reported him but yet the people at the ALLEGED """"help desk"""" refused to tell me where to report him, and even deleted several of my replies and then archived it fraudulently.  Having OTHER USERS delete my comments, participate in blatant fradulent..ism, post the same thing on multiple talk pages at once for the purpose of harassing me, etc., is hardly """"myself making it difficult to communicate,"""" when in fact as was just demonstrated I did the LITERAL EXACT OPPOSITE of this by LITERALLY ATTEMPTING TO PREVENT OTHER USERS FROM MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE.  ((In addition, if I wish for other users to NOT communicate with me, I also have THAT right, it is in fact specifically written into law in every state in the country and will get you arrested if you fail to do so.  Although I personally disagree with this law and it is an immoral law which deems to prevent for example ex-spouses from communicating with each other when necessary, the part of the law that refers to STRANGERS such as on Wikipedia or anywhere on the Internet, it is a PERSONAL CHOICE whether you wish other strangers on the site to communicate with you or not and/or post contact information etc.  That is why every message board in existence has an option to """"disable the private messaging system"""".))

There were no personal attacks done by me anywhere, so this part is a baseless and fraudulent claim.

""""Refusal to abide by the site's guidelines"""" is impossible since 1) """"guidelines"""" and """"rules"""" are two different thing 2) Wikipedia does not have any rules and 3) All policies of any kind are subject to debate and protest at any time according to the numerous Wikipedia articles which specifically say this.

0,"""Please don't use antisemitic claptrap as a source==
Please don't insult Wikipedia readers and editors by sourcing opinionated statements with antisemitic claptrap found on Rense.com. Are you really expecting editors to find Goebbelesque garbage like """"The multi-faceted assault on MacDonald's position as a tenured professor is a chilling reminder of the level of Jewish excess and Jewish tenacity Americans are now facing"""" acceptable as a WP:RS?  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  
What's wrong with the source? —  (Discussion · contribs) 
Oh and, where did you get the """"insult Wikipedia readers and editors"""" from? Are you some kind of automatically self-offended dude? You seem to think everything is offensive. How is a source, offensive? How does a website, having opinions critical of Jewish behaviour, fail WP:RS? Are you suggesting that WP:RS can only be applied on sources which cannot have critical opinions about Jews? What if the website is actually telling the truth (though opinionated). Don't you think it's ignorant to disregard it on the basis that it has opinions you disagree with? —  (Discussion · contribs) 
""""You seem to think everything is offensive."""" Actually no, not everything, just ill-informed blanket generalizations about other people's state of mind. What if the antisemitic claptrap you used as a source is true, you ask? Hey could be....oh, look, a pig just flew by my window.....  
Wow, that was really funny. Anyway, MacDonald has been attacked several times by American Jews for allegedly being """"antisemite"""" (you know, that awesome word which has any actual academic value beside shutting down legitimate criticism of Jews). This, for instance, in FrontPageMag by Jacob Laksin. He has come under a lot of heat from the SPLC, which I'm sure you're already aware of. Now, recently, the SPLC has been pushing to get him dissociated from his university. All this, has that rense source (which you, eloquently, call """"antisemitic claptrap"""") covered. I don't see the problem here. It seems to me, you dismiss this rense source as a WP:RS, not because of any false writings, but because, there are opinions you dislike and deem, """"insulting"""". —  (Discussion · contribs) 
Dude, the term """"antisemite"""" has no actual academic value beside shutting down legitimate criticism of Jews? Do me a favor, please don't discuss anything with me regarding your views on theis subject and stick SOLELY to discussion of editing and improving this artcile, because your views are simply too offensive and abhorrent to have to volunarily subject myself to. By the way, I edited the entry to reflect what the College newspaper actually reports, which is that the moves against Macdonald are a result of opposition from school faculty. Despite the fact that bigots like rense like to whine about how evil Jews are persecuting antisemites like Macdonald, I'm afraid the professor has only himself to blame.   
Sorry, but I'm not here to appease your """"getting offended"""" radar. If you feel offended every single time someone is critical of Jews, such as Kevin MacDonald, you have a serious emotional problem, or, you're probably Jewish. MacDonald has himself to blame? Wrong. MacDonald has written three scholarly books on Jews, Judaism, and Jewish political movements. That's his right to do so if he wants to and he should not get into trouble because of it, since, last I checked, the 1st amendment was still valid in America (or so they say). What next? You want to criminalise political criticism of Jews too? Anyway, this is what the source states:

PPPPS.  Here, for example, are Kulke and Rothermund, in their History of India 4th edition:  The various stages of the indigenous evolution of the Indus civilisation can be documented by an analysis of four sites which have been excavated in more recent years: Mehrgarh, Amari, Kalibangan, Lothal. These four sites reflect the sequence of the four important phases in the protohistory of the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent. The sequence begins with the transition of nomadic herdsmen to settled agriculturists in eastern Baluchistan, continues with the growth of large villages in the Indus valley and the rise of towns, leads to the emergence of the great cities and, finally, ends with their decline. The first stage is exemplified by Mehrgarh in Baluchistan, the second by Amri in the southern Indus valley and the third and fourth by Kalibangan in Rajasthan and by Lothal in Gujarat.  In other words, the language changes when IVC is discussed.

What say you?  Can we lay down the hatchet and move past this?"
0,""":: This discussion belongs to years ago, so I hope that my comment will still be helpful. First of all, a necessary preamble: consonants in Italian can be double or single, as is well known; however, what is often overlooked in this description is that this contrast can only occur in certain positions, i.e. in between vowels or between a vowel and a """"semivowel"""" (/w/ and /j/) or, for plosives, between a vowel and """"r""""/""""l""""; in all other position all consonants have an indeterminate length. So in the word """"pasto"""" (""""meal"""") neither the """"s"""" nor the """"t"""" can be described as being """"single"""" or """"double"""", they have an intermidiate, indeterminate length (pronouncing something like """"passto"""" or """"pastto"""" would be meaningless in Italian phonology, unlike other languages featuring geminate consonants like Finnish). So, applying this concept to the pronunciation of """"r"""": single """"r"""" is pronounced as a flap, double and indeterminate """"r"""" are pronounced as a trill in standard pronounciation; for example """"caro"""" (dear) contains a flap, while """"terra"""" (earth) and """"treno"""" (train) both contain a trill. You can check this listening to the entries of the """"Dizionario di Ortografia e Pronuncia"""", published by the Italian state television RAI and which is (or used to be) available on this page. Using the trill in """"caro"""", no matter how short, would inevitably turn it into """"carro"""" (charriot). 
I am a native speaker, I've taught Italian to foreigners and I have studied and compared Italian phonology in depth. Of course, this claims are not sufficient for wikipedia, but there's an inherent problem when referencing publications on the subject. For long time phonology has been considered in Italy just a lesser part of grammar; more importantly, most study focussed on internal controversies and variations, i.e. describing the language from within the language, a more objective and scientific study of the phonetics is quite limited. It suffices to say that even IPA has hardly ever been used in the description of Italian phonetics, many authors using custom phonetic conventions even in promimenent works (such as the one I linked before). This means that while the contrast between /e/ and /ɛ/ or /ɔ/ and /o/ is widely discussed in many pubblication because there's a lot of variation in distribution, little work can be found about other distinctive traits of Italian phonology that are uniform or nearly so among native speakers (e.g. the assimilation of place of articulation of """"n"""" with the following consonant; the lengthening of the vowel in stressed, open syllables inside words; phonetic value of syllables like in /pas.to/ contrasting with the prescribed orthographic split """"pa-sto"""", syllable-timed rythm, etc.). The difference of distribution of flap vs trill for """"r"""", as well as an accurate description of consonants of incontrastive length in general, has been largely disreguarded.

 Advice 

Hallo, I see you've added several articles to Wikipedia about Lifestyle brands etc.  A few points:
Please learn how to add Categories - see the changes I've made to your articles
Please check where your links are going: I've fixed a link to Patagonia which was intended for Patagonia (clothing), but you've got links to disambiguation pages in your Icon brand article.
Please do not add blog sites as External links - see WP:ELNO
You can make a link to Icon brand from the words """"Icon brands"""" by adding an """"s"""" at the end of the link: [[Icon brand]]s. Much neater than repeating the whole thing in a piped link.
The See Also section should not include articles which are already linked within the article.
Please don't use informal language like """"it's"""" for """"it is"""": this is an encyclopedia. (It's quite OK on talk pages).
There is a lot to learn about editing Wikipedia, but it is an interesting journey. Happy Editing. D """

In 1534, King Henry VIII, was refused a divorce from the Pope.  Henry then decided to break with Rome, and found his own church.  The Church of England (today know as Church of England, Anglican Churhc, Episcopalian (in the USA, and Scotland) was thus created in 1534.  Since Henry was of Welsh blood, he took power over both England and Wales in Personal Union.  Henry confiscated all Roman Catholic Church Lands (well 90%) in England and Wales, and transfered them to the Church of England.

In 1536, the Act of Union of 1536, formal merged the Parliamentary Powers of England and Wales, whose seat of parliament is todays British House of Commons.  Thus, the Personal Union lasted only two years (1534-1536), and the formal Legislative Union of England and Wales lasts to this day."

On second thought, Max, I just took a look at the history and saw that you posted not only the link that you say you're not defending, but also the link to the material from the white supremacist antisemite, William Pierce. There's no need to keep the link on the page while discussing its merits (although that link has no merits to discuss). Wikipedia's editors know how to look at edit histories. When a link is that egregious and beyond the pale, any responsible editor will remove it until it's existence can be justified. Also, I didn't """"remove an external link """"without cause."""" I explained my cause, both here and in the edit summary. That cause was not a """"claim that it's offensive in some way,"""" but a clear, obvious violation of WP:EL and WP:RS with regard to fringe websites.

However, I've just taken a look at your edit history, and can honestly say that, outside of your edits to this article, I can't see any evidence of an antisemitic agenda on your part, so I'm going to continue to WP:AGF. However, it will be to your advantage to recognize that editors who are accustomed to working on Judaism-related articles have long experience with users who """"just innocently raise the question"""" of whether there might be racist material in the Talmud, or whether there just might be a Jewish conspiracy for world domination, or whether we've fairly portrayed the views of folks who think that The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a genuine document, and shouldn't we leave the material up while we discuss it? The answer to that question is no, and if my assumption of good faith is justified, you'll have no trouble seeing why.

Again, Max, follow those links and you'll see why neither you, nor I, nor any responsible editor would want them to stay on this article or any other that we had a hand in. I'm honestly not trying to start a feud or a flame war or anything else, and I do wish you the best experience possible on Wikipedia.  """

Hey Loyola,

WikiAfrica invites you to support the Africa Incubator

WikiAfrica is pleased to invite you as a self-declared African Wikipedian to evaluate the Africa Incubator. WikiAfrica has created the Africa Incubator to support and assist new authors, as they create their first articles and learn the ins and outs of contributing to Wikipedia.

The Africa Incubator is a ‘soft landing’ for new authors to develop articles that relate to Africa. It assists them in becoming compliant and knowledgeable of Wikipedia principles and rules. Based within the Wikipedia framework, the Africa Incubator is fully interactive and enables feedback, assistance and forums.

This is where we need your help! For the Africa Incubator to be successful, it needs the intervention, interaction and experience of Incubator Mentors. We are looking for a pool of active experienced Wikipedians to consistently participate in ’owning’ the Africa Incubator. Incubator Mentors will assist new comers through the editing process. They will also help test and expand the Africa Incubator, and will play a vital role in encouraging newcomers to be Wikipedians for life 

Please visit WikiAfrica Incubator  to give us your honest feedback and evaluation.

Again, NK never existed as a region before 1920s. While Nagorno translates as mountainous, it was never a separate region. And NK as a region is separated from Armenia by Kelbajar, Lachin and other districts of Azerbaijan. The sources above do not say that NK existed as a stand alone region historically. Even Russian imperial administrative divisions such as Jevanshir and Shusha uyezds included both mountainous and lowland parts of the region. So we need to clarify that NK as a region did not border Armenia. If we are talking about geographic region of Karabakh, then its mountainous part extends right to the border with Armenia, however upper and lower Karabakh historically formed a single region, and geographic concept of Karabakh includes both highlands and lowlands. The history of NK as a historical and political notion starts in 1920s, when it was artificially carved out of Karabakh to become an autonomy for Armenians. It was purely a Soviet invention. master """

An RfC from one article is not sufficient justification for enacting similar changes to another article, even if both articles cover similar topics. The races should be mentioned in the bios, because race is biographical information. Other than that, unless there is good evidence that this was a racially motivated death (is there any evidence of such whatsoever?), it's simply not relevant. I support your position in that RfC to include the races in the bios, and omit them in the lede. I should also note that many of our sources are for-profit media outlets who have no qualms about distorting stories to make them fit their most profitable narrative agenda, which, in this era, is black/white racial conflict (the coverage of the Trayvon Martin shooting is an excellent example).

Edit 25 Nov 07
The anonymous editor immediately before me believed that they had """"deleted weasel words, tried to bring it back to a neutral perspective"""". The edit was a basic misunderstanding of the Secret History; I wouldn't be surprised if they hadn't read the work. The SH does indeed """"claim to"""" report, rather than """"report"""" scandals in Justinian's reign: the work remains completely uncorroborated by any other contemporary witness, and some of the purported scandals are so outrageous, the causes given by Procopius so bizarre and unknowable (viz., that Justinian was a devil and had the gift of invisibility), that much of it does not so much report anything as give vent to the bile of the author: that's why I let stand the deletion of """"apparently"""" (""""The Secret History apparently reveals an author who had become deeply disillusioned""""), since that particular word is a """"weasel word"""" on the part of some Wikipedia editor. But the so-called 'revelations' are indeed """"titillating (and doubtful)"""" rather than """"revealing"""" (and """"revealing revelations"""" is very bad copy editing, too). Similarly again, given that there is no doubt that the same author wrote both the SH and the Buildings, the panegyric of Justinian is undeniably insincere; since the Buildings bears the mark of official patronage in other respects, the panegyric can indeed be viewed as written at Justinian's behest, or something like it: stet. All of this is ground well traveled by the various editors of the work over the centuries, and represents the clear consensus of modern scholars.   """

Hello, Xeltifon. Someone963852 is simply going by our rules on this. There won't be enough work that you can do to make it acceptable to mention in the lead that zoophilia is a sexual orientation. It has been made extensively clear on this talk page and elsewhere that it is a fringe assertion to call it a sexual orientation, per WP:FRINGE. The Wikipedia:Fringe theories/Noticeboard would also make this clear if this matter were taken there. Zoophilia either shouldn't be called a sexual orientation in this article at all or can only be called one with WP:DUE WEIGHT; it is already mentioned with due weight lower in this article. You saw where it is mentioned lower, as you added it in. However, such a sexual orientation mention was included lower in the article before at some point (different points in time).
 
And with regard to what you stated in this edit summary about the lead, that is not exactly what WP:LEAD says. Citations may or may not be allowed in the lead, but are usually advised to be in the lead for controversial topics. Zoophilia is clearly a controversial topic.

And regarding bolding the terms, alternative terms should be bolded in the lead. Sometimes, they are also bolded lower in the article at first mention. See WP:BOLDTITLE. I would object to your removal of the alternative terms from the lead, per WP:Alternative titles, but, also per WP:Alternative titles, """"If there are at least three alternative names, or there is something notable about the names themselves, a separate name section is recommended."""" And, as you know, there is a section in this article to discuss these terms. Still, it is sometimes best to mention the alternative titles in the lead as well, especially if one or more of them is very well known as an alternative title.

0,"US States name game is a terrible example 

Due to the limited number of states, this game would be over almost as quickly as it started.  Why?  Consider:
Over 40% (21 out of 50) of states end in the letter 'A'.  Of the four states that start in 'A', three (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona) also end in 'A', and the fourth, Arkansas, would lead you to either South Carolina or South Dakota, both of which end in 'A', and thus you'd be stuck in an endless loop of 6 states from which you cannot escape.  This loop is almost completely unavoidable.  The example given in the article is already stuck in this loop.
Almost as many (18 states) start with a letter that no other state ends in.  So the only way these states would ever come up in gameplay is if you started with them.  Of these states, we also have the only state ending in a 'T' (Connecticut) and the only state ending in an 'H' (Utah).  Thus, you can add Hawaii, Tennessee, and Texas to the list of states that will almost never come up.
The only way you won't end up stuck in the endless 'A'-loop is if you somehow land on one of the five states (Delaware, New Hampshire, Tennessee (unlikely as seen above), Kentucky, and New Jersey) that end in a letter no other state starts with, at which point the game would be over.
There are numerous other pitfalls; consider Ohio.  You could either loop endlessly on Ohio, or go to Oklahoma, thus falling into the 'A'-loop, or you could go to Oregon.  From there you could go to Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, and North Dakota, all falling again into the 'A'-loop.  Or you could hit New Hampshire or New Jersey, both game enders, or New Mexico, which just takes you back where you started, or finally New York.  New York then leads to Kentucky (ending the game) or Kansas (falling via South Carolina or South Dakota back into the 'A'-loop yet again.)
Maybe Nations of the World would be a better example.  There's more of them for one thing, though still quite a few ending or starting in 'A' (and again a large number of which both start and end in 'A', so the loop still exists, but it's larger and easier to get out of).  Also, most letters of the alphabet are represented at the beginning or end of at least one country, so you'd be less likely to get stuck, and there aren't so many of them which could never appear.  (A few exist - can't think of any countries ending in 'J', 'V' or 'Z' - sorry Jordan, Vietnam, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe, probably more but I'd have to do a more thorough search.)  Anyhow, maybe I'm crazy for noticing stuff like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning."

Turkey is regionally considered middle Eastern by most countries regardless of including the statement. The statement was put there so others wont think that a country like Turkey could possibly have influence on a continent like Europe. By adding that, one is implying that Turkey isn't good enough to influence Europe even though no one is claiming it does. It is also making sure no one assumes Turkey is anything but Middle Eastern.

Hi.  Do you have a source for your addition to the Georgian language page where you said that ფ is pronounced as /f/ when it corresponds to an /f/ sound in loan words from Greek and other languages?

For example, პროფესია (profession, occupation) is pronounced /p'rɔpʰɛsia/ (not /p'rɔfɛsia/).  As far as I am aware, /f/ is not a separate phoneme in Georgian; rather, it occurs only as an alternative pronunciation of ვ before unvoiced consonants.

Had they used full flaps all the way, the extra drag would reduce acceleration so that it would take longer to reach even the lower speed now needed. On aircraft with more power, more flap deflection is possible, always balancing the additional drag with the reduction in acceleration.

Year of the Five Emperors
I've had to revert your group's changes to this article for various reasons, which I'll try to explain as clearly as possible. 

As the page topic is """"Year of the Five Emperors"""", the text should provide only as much biographical information as readers need in order to thoroughly understand the topic (in this instance, what happened in that year or during that event). I agree that some kind of potted biography is needed for each claimant, but a lot less than has been provided - we already have articles on each of them. The article should cover  (in other words, what happened that year, why it happened at all, who was involved and why, their fate, and (probably) the consequences of all this for the Empire and its people. Try to maintain a strong, sound and logical article structure, based always on the topic. 

Please also note our source requirements; modern scholarly treatments by specialists in the field are preferred over older treatments; both are preferred over primary sources (this is especially so when it comes to the notoriously problematic Historia Augusta, for example). Some online sources are OK, but take care to establish their authorship, credentials and scholarly standing. Generalised treatments (such as other paper or online encyclopedias, school textbooks etc., particularly older sources, will tend to offer no more than an outline, and may not reflect the most recent scholarly thinking on the topic. By the way, Wikipedia articles can't be used as sources; but their sources can, as long as they're sound; in that case, you'd not be citing the article but its sources (as above).

0,"Too Many Articles 

While we have been discussing things about this article, many changes seem to have been made in other articles related to Urdu. There are now SEVEN articles on Urdu and Hindi.  They are: Hindi-Urdu, Hindustani, Hindi-Urdu Word Etymology, History of Hindustani, Hindi, Urdu (this one) and Hindi-Urdu Grammar. I noted that the number of speakers has been removed from the Hindi article, the article on Hindustani is gone and what remains is a re-direct, and the Hindi-Urdu article has a reasonable number of speakers at 490 million.  

I think it is time to combine and cross reference these articles so that people can get some use out of them.  I suggest that we eliminate the number of speakers from this article altogether and let it rest with one of the other articles where there is no controversy since the article is about both languages."

 Sockpuppet 

Re this block, I'm interested in the sequence of events. (I am not an administrator, so I don't know necessarily where to look, and I'm not sure what to look for either.) I followed this drama for a day. I was one of several people who warned the user that a block was likely forthcoming, which happened. The block was appealed several times until an admin unblocked (too soon, in my view but again, I'm not an admin). So shortly after the unblock, you identified the user as a sockpuppet. (Well, probably you blocked because of it.) So my question is this, as a relative newcomer - some time and effort could have been saved here - and maybe it was but I just don't know it. Can you shed a little light on the sequence of events after the unblock, or that were occurring elsewhere while the block/unblock was going on? (I'll watch your page or you can email me from mine.)

The freedom to buy, own, and resell property?  What is economic freedom?  What are economic rights?  If you look at economic freedom as a matter of having the liberty to do make and spend money without state interference, American liberalism is pretty far from it, with American conservative orbiting little closer.  American government is rife with policies designed to encourage or punish specific economic behavior with taxation.  We don't want people to smoke, so we tax the hell out of cigarettes.  Is that economic liberty?  We want people to own property rather than rent, so we let homeowners write off interest, but not renters.  Is it economic freedom that people who can't afford a home or who have poor credit are punished by not being able to write-off part of their domicile expense?  No, neither philosophy even remotely resembles economic freedom by any conventional definition.  Both abuse the power of government to try to manage the economy, influence the economic behavior of citizens, and encourage and discourage specific personal decisions based on a code of morality unique to each philosophy."

0,""":::::: Dear Chris, It took me a while to uderstand what happened. Finally I came to a conclusion that you exploded (see your """"seen in the above insulting comments"""" which I couldn't find above, if you think they are above please quote them) because we are just from different cultures. I'm guessing (and correct me if I'm wrong) that you just don't accept the culture like mine. You say """"where you stand in your own mind with Einstein, Landau and Feynman against a world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools"""". Why do you think that """"Einstein, Landau and Feynman"""" are with me against the world? My guess: since they all are atheists who don't believe in the supernatural as you and this ironically mentioned """"world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools"""". So we offended your feelings. And we are insulting your culture.

 If I guessed right (and if I did, you won't protest since it would be to stand against your God, so you have an option not to respond) please accept my appologies since I never meant to make fun of your faith. I just don't believe it is true in a scientific sense so the offense is somehow automatic if an atheist (who is never offended by someone elses opinion on the scientific truth) discusses science with a believer. I should be taught by experience, since BB proponents are always offended by my texts and until now I'd never understood the reason, before I read Zimbardo, that is, and learned about deep feelings of those people. Deep feelings that atheits like myself don't have and that's why I've never uderstood them earlier. 

 If I'm wrong (you don't believe that there is a God) then I have to think that you are just a fool if you are feeling offended by my disagreement to a certain scientific hypothesis (actually considered by me an unscientific but to be PC we can't discuss it anymore). So suddenly the discussion became an ideological one.

 I totally agree with you that it is nonsense to classify heterogenous nomadic confederations in Asia as """"one particular ethnic group"""". The Huns, the Hephthalites, the Rouran, and even the Turks and Mongols were coalitions of a bunch of different nomadic tribes of all kinds of origins - from Indo-Iranian Scythians to Siberian proto-Altaics. Yet, we have to have SOME standard in here. And the best way to do that is to stick to authoritative sources. 
 The EI and EIr are collections of major sources and quotes; both Ei and EIr make clear that neather the Chionites nor the Hephthalites (or Gök-Turks) were homogenous. As for the Hephthalites, the usage of Mongolian and Turkic titles (such as Khaqan) is attested in the scripts of Bactria. Yet, the ruling elite was most probable of Eastern Iranian origin. That's why Chinese sources, such as the """"Pey-Shi"""" considered them members of the """"Yüe-Chi"""", who were Indo-European Tocharians. We can't just assume certain origins because of some royal titles. Not everyone who used the title """"Khaqan"""" was automatically a Turk or Mongol. The best example for this is the Indo-European title """"Yabghu"""" (probably from Tocharian or Iranian) whi was almost exclusively used by Non-Indo-European Turks. Now, we can assume that - at some point in history - the early Turks were ruled by an Indo-European-speaking elite (probably Tocharian or Iranian Scythian), but this is not enough to call the early Turks a """"mix of Indo-European and Altaic peoples"""" (see Turkic peoples).

If demand is high and supply is low, price is high... etc.  Petroleum can be stored in many places, such as in the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (727 million barrels).  Global strategic petroleum reserves hold over 4 billion barrels.  Supply, which is the refined petroleum (and other liquids) available in the open market, is affected by releases of strategic reserves (note that production is not the same as supply).  Depending on the source you read demand and usage might not even be the same thing, as demand might include buyers for strategic reserves.  

Most of the big issues with Peak oil begin with the fact that until recently demand has grown very steadily for a long time, catching up with production.  When production can not go up anymore (and begins to decline), the strategic reserves will slowly be used up until supply also begins to decline.  Then usage will be forced to decline, but demand could theoretically keep going up (imagine a room with one cupcake, full of people yelling for more).

Greetings and blessings. 
I have edited the links section to add few Mashichist sites to give a greater range  of Chabad views on the issue of identity of Moshiach and the proccess of redemption. While I realize Wikipedia is not a link list I feel that all those sites should be included. I have also moved the """"Breif history of Chabad Messianism""""  to the historical sites section from it's original location in the Chabad Messianic sites section since it's not a Mashichist propaganda, but
 the author of the article simply presents an overview of the development of the Moshiach identification campaign within Chabad and further states elsewhere on his site that he doesn't believe the Rebbe is Moshiach therefore it obviously doesn't belong in the Chabad Messianic sites section.
I have also added the http://www.YudelKrinsky.com as satire is just another way to convey information and studying it creates a clearer picture about the issue in the mind of a serious Wikipedia reader.

Maybe after a hard day in the hood with his scout charges this scoutmaster relaxes by expressing himself through rap.

Its my experience of right-wingers that on the whole they don't want you to know what they are up too. I remember an arts center open mic night which I was attending being infiltrated by five or six or them. It was a surreal situation because none of them were actually musicians - they pretended to be comedians which allowed them the right to attend and perform. The woman who ran the night and who had no idea of how the BNP (British National Party) worked and put one of them in charge. I emailed the arts center due to the fact that I knew some of the people who ran the open mic nights (including the woman who had been put in overall charge and had made the decision to put him in charge) and got an email back saying the open mic nights were for everyone regardless of their political views. A week or two later I received another email saying that the arts center had decided to separate the comedy from the music by having separate nights for both. I'm  not too sure why but I do know that at one of the open mic nights the leader of this small BNP cell had been put in charge and after one of the singers had finished (she was colored) he said something that was really strange. I can't say what because people who were there may be reading this but it was racist. About a hundred people witnessed and heard what he said and everyone just sat silently in shock not knowing how to react - after all he was in charge. Now that is power. When you can persuade others that your intent is one thing and then position yourself to impose your will or views upon those who believe your original lie - well that is political power. Its not even a right wing thing since many left wing leaders have used to same ploy. It is the nature of a dogmatic personality who is seeking power to follow such a course when faced with opposition to their dogma. Here's what happened after the torrent scene released the membership list of the BNP and I spotted that one of them was a town planning consultant employed by my local council. I sent an email to my council of course. Evidently my council believe that hiring a BNP member as a town planning consultant for one of the most highly diverse ethnic towns in England was fine because his racist views shouldn't affect his ability to provide good advice. lol

 A few ideas to balance the US centric style.

Whilst you have brought in large area of British (mainly English and Welsh) facts neverthe less the opening paragraphs are somewhat US based.  I have no knowledge whatsoever on anything other than the UK perspective (though as this contributes significantly to US law, it will at least set some history.  

I am also a little bit concerned at why juries were created in the first place, you state that this is because they are believed to be free from bribery. Historically, trial by jury arose because of the difficulties of securing trial by ordeal, due to a change in church law.  By that time juries already sat to decide if there was a primae facie case to answer (the modern equivalent being Grand Juries).

The history of trial by jury (in England and hence the US) is related to several important events, most notebly the Assizes of Clarendon, the Fourth Lantern Council and the Magna Carta.

It may be useful for you to have a look at some of the wikipedia sites listed below:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_ordeal

""""In the Assize of Clarendon, enacted in 1166 and the first great legislative act in the reign of the English Angevin King Henry II, the law of the land required that: """"anyone, who shall be found, on the oath of the aforesaid [a jury], to be accused or notoriously suspect of having been a robber or murderer or thief, or a receiver of them ... be taken and put to the ordeal of water.""""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Lateran_Council

Canons 14-18. Rules on the conduct of the clergy including against such things as: non-celibate living, drunkenness, frequenting taverns, hunting, conducting trials by ordeal or combat 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta

Though you may be best considering the uk statute site which says:
http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1517519

""""NO Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor [X5 condemn him,] but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land.""""

Aha! So Kayla and Kailina are the same; but there's more to be explained. After checking some more sources I think we can be sure of the existence of at least two separate Agaw dialects/languages (just like Bender 1976:8 says; but unlike Ethnologue and Sommer 1992): first, Qemant-Kemant-Chemant-Kamant-Kimantinya-Kimanteney, and secondly Kayla-Kaila-Kailinya (ethnonym Betə Israel (cf. Mann & Dalby 1987:16), xenonyms Falasha/Felasha from Ge'ez 'immigrant, stranger'; Yihudi (cf. Ethnologue 1992 as cited in Sommer 1992). Kemant could be extinct by now (Sommer 1992 mentions that """"according to Gamst, Kemant is threatened by extinction""""). In any case, a huge language shift is going on here; all speakers are bilingual in Amharic and according to Ethnologue, only 1650 native speakers of Kemant were left, out of an ethnic group of about 170,000 people in 1998. Endangered, to say the least.
Quirin (1998) leads me to believe that an important reason for Qemant and Kayla being separate languages is that their speakers (coming from a common Agaw base) developed separate identities from the beginning of the 14th century on. However, apparently there's a lot of fuss going on in Beta Israel historiography (cf. e.g. ) and I don't know enough about it at present to judge sources like this (though Qurin seems to have done his homework).
Anyway, a third dialect seems to be Qwera/Quara/Qwarina/'Kara of Kwarasa'/Hwara/Hwarasa; this one appears to be extinct (cf. Ethnologue). It seems to have been related more closely to Qemant — Gamst (p.c. to Sommer, Sommer 1992:358) proposes that """"Quara, Quarinya, spoken by a few Falasha in Quara (to the west of Qemant-land), is nearly the same language as Qemant.""""

 GISIN page edits 

Thanks for your attention to the GISIN wiki page.  However, RE: your removal of """"note that this should NOT be construed as finalized, and should ONLY be used in the context of working with other GISIN partners in a development context"""": this was added because (at least one of) the GISIN participants were worried that folks might begin attempting to use the (draft) GISIN protocol for development.  In fact, they asked me (yes, I know, it's a wiki, they could have done it themselves...) to change the wording on the page to make SURE no one began investing time in what is now a moving target.  Is it really that bad to have this clarification there?  (""""Draft"""" may mean different things to different people.)  If it makes you feel any better (which I'm guessing it won't, because I know you have a particular reason for your edit), that part won't stay there forever; eventually, the protocol will be released as a """"live"""" (perhaps versioned) product, so this disclaimer will be unnecessary.  However, at this point, I fear that the person who asked me to make the change (who is basically the technical lead on the GISIN project) will become (perhaps justifiably) annoyed if this point is not made clear to his satisfaction.  (He actually requested that the GISIN Wikipedia entry be DELETED if this weren't made clear.)

So... any way you could see fit to re-include that text (or something similar that would serve the same purpose)?

(P.S. - As I think about it, in truth, the onus should really be on the maintainer of the linked sites to ensure that anyone that got to that URL would knowin terms that the site author wants folks to knowthat it """"should NOT be construed as finalized, and should ONLY be used in the context of working with other GISIN partners in a development context"""".... hmmm...

 why do you hate the poor? 

I've been following your posts/articles/biases and I find a frighteningly strong Right wing bias.  What were you raised rich?  Do you come from old money?

I am wealthy and well off too, but there is no need to flaunt or even protect our own money.  In fact the life we have lived should be enough happiness for us.  We shouldn't be always asking for more more more.  We need to learn to find time and space to say """"that's enough for me, please help my fellow man"""".

How can you not give a child who has never had a supportive dad, a clean mom, or a stable neighborhood to grow up on a second chance?  How can you not give a 16 year old girl who accidently got pregnant a second chance to live a normal life, rather than have an unwanted child who will never get the same love and support if it were to be born to a responsible parent?
2)  You hate or have no apathy for the poor
my comment is how can you have the poor and absolutely abhor any programs that help them if you have never been there yourself.  What would a rich upper class fellow like you know what its like to be starving and homeless on the streets of NYC or Miami after you have served your country in 2 different wars?

0,"The problem is not only or perhaps even primarily with companies, but with non profit organizations, and pressure groups of all sorts. The problem is not primarily with skilled PR professionals, but less skilled people assigned to it, or simply amateurs. There's a good deal of COI editing of companies and products done by fans of the products, not by the companies, and some degree of conflict of interest permeates most of Wikipedia. Almost everything I ever worked on is either because I am interested in it, or want to show off my virtuosity. 
And I agree with Dennis that in most cases we might as well deal with COI on the article page directly, as with other edits. King4057, and others, have asked me at times to approve article drafts they have COI with I have refused to do so, because I will not take the responsibility for something I have not written, beyond seeing it is not blatantly objectionable. Let COI editors declare the affiliations, and then their edits will be judged appropriately. The only time that an edit needs approval on a talk p. is when it is dealing with something that is obviously susceptible, such as removing inconvenient facts.   
The true question is the same with this approach as with prohibiting direct COI editing:  how do we deal with COI editing from people who do not declare it. I see only two approaches. One is to have an high index of suspicion for every edit that might be influenced by conflict of interest, in essence abandoning the principle of Assuming Good Faith. The difficulty here is that very few can write material that is truly at a standard of sourcing that is proof against the possibility of bad faithit requires not only that statements be sourced, but being confident that all the sources have been examined and fairly considered and judge in context. Very little in enWP meets that standard. This would require actual research and fact checking at a degree which is beyond our capabilities, and amounting to what is done by the most careful editorial review. This is not work for amateurs.  It is easy to say, that if our standards are sufficiently high COI will not matter, but this  The other approach is to require all editors to be identified. The principle of permitting anonymous editing makes us vulnerable; it is necessary for those working on certain topics, but there it might have to be assured by some confidential mechanism for assigning names. Either approach means a radical change in Wikipedia.    
The only simple approach is the same we have used for other problems: patiently remove the worst of it, and go from there. '''''' ( talk )"

 Good to hear. I think the article reflects Dateline and PJ and the chap. Positive, negative, that's for the reader to decide.

 Why will Gwen Gale not read the sources? 

On 01:27, 5 August 2010 I posted a section on """"Talk: Death of Adolf Hitler"""" titled “Random Questions” which started “I am not a scholar, I read Wiki but would not think of editing it. But I was disappointed in this article, and many points in the discussion, so I am asking some questions. Perhaps someone else will read and address them.” The section went on with several rethoritical questions, and ended with “As to sources, the last books I have read are The Murder of Adolph Hitler by Hugh Thomas (sort of shaky) and The Last Days of Hitler by Anton Joachimsthaler (English translation, I buy much of this).”

Gwen Gale was apparently assigned me as an administrator, because at  she replied with: ”As the article lead says,...This said, this talk page isn't a forum for talking about personal views or questions on a topic, it's meant for talking about sources and how to echo them in the text. I say this because the article seems to already cover, with thorough citations, most if not all of what you've brought up...dodgy. Gwen Gale (talk)”

By this reply it appears that Gwen Gale is NOT FAMILIAR with the work of Joachimsthaler, who I have just referenced, and thinks that I am asking a personal question, not a rhetorical one. At that time I apologized, tried to explain myself, and restate my questions.

At  I posted” If I had read Kershaw's Nemesis Chapter 17 note 156 and Epilogue note 1 I wouldn't have wasted your time. You can't get much clearer than that. Should be required reading. Perhaps someone else should read them, and possibly edit the article. Thank you for your time.99.41.251.5 (talk)”

At  I posted “I would like to direct people to the work of Ian Kershaw Hitler, 1939-1945: Nemesis ISBN 0393322521. Chapter 17 and the epilogue relate to this article. Please pay attention to his notes and sources. Be warned, his book Hitler: a Biography is a kind of digest which does not include these resources....The source Joachimsthaler is basically an English translation of a German's analysis of 1950's post-Soviet interviews of bunker survivors. The original transcripts must be available somewhere. There are many other bunker interviews, some with questionable intent, and not all agree. Wm5200 (talk)“

Since those posts I have posted a huge amount on the talk page, virtually all of which Gwen Gale has disputed. Much of the material I have posted I have later deleted, often because I felt that the endless conflict between Gwen Gale and myself is counterproductive to the article.

Anyone who is Wiki can probably bring back any of those posts. Was I sometimes rude and argumentative? Absolutely. Was I making legitimate points which related to the article? I thought so. Did I receive effective support and encouragement by my administrator? I think not, but you judge.

My main point was that Joachimsthaler had reviewed the information, and had made a solid case for positions which Kershaw backed. I repeatedly begged anyone, especially Gwen Gale, to read Joachimsthaler and Kershaw, specifically, two footnotes, I even told the pages of the footnotes. Gwen Gale clearly had not read either source.

 I posted, under the heading “Question for Gwen Gale” , the following: ”I lost you, but I’m confused myself. It appears as though the person with the least information available is most influential on the article.

The U.S. is big on free press, and it works. My very low budget suburb is in a system which serves 225,000 people with 4 MILLION titles (numbers approximate, thanks Carol). That’s on the next shuttle van. Most of the rest of the assets of a state with 12 million people are a couple of days away by mail. The specialty stuff on AE from Radcliffe took maybe a week. And I am an amateur. Dan, you are over three million people higher in the food chain, you must be “world class”. Kierzek has clearly read and analyzed everything, reviewed most of it, and as far as I can tell, every word he says is accurate and informed.

Kershaw, Joachimsthaler, Thomas, Trevor-Roper, Beevor, Shirer, Ryan, Toland, Eberle/Uhl, Lehmann/Carroll, O’Donnell, Victor, Petrova/Watson. (Vinogradov hit a snag, reordered). These are books which I have had in my possession and read parts of since Aug 2010. I can understand if others do not have access to the same resources, but I think that should be addressed. If someone does not have access to two footnotes which are critical in a discussion, that also should be addressed...I know that this is P.O.V., and that I am personally involved. But I can not help but believe that this article has problems with it’s process.Wm5200 (talk)'""""

 In my opinion, the three lists you just mentioned need improvement to reach the standards of the Oregon and Washington lists (that is completely independent of the fact that I promoted those two lists to FL statusthey simply contain more facts, stronger leads, more references, etc).  I think that a single table is more appropriate as it can be sorted and the order of sections seem somewhat arbitrary by making some symbols more important than others. Also, I believe it is crucial to separate official and unofficial symbols. I have no problem with having a table for the """"Unofficial symbols"""" sectionit just happens that the Oregon and Washington lists only have a couple so it was easier to construct prose than tables. I know nothing about Governors lists, but I believe some have been promoted to FL status so it is probably worth examining those. Hopefully I will get around to improving the Maryland, Kentucky and Indiana symbols lists. In the meantime (just to make the FLC nomination process easier and for the sake of consistency) I would mimic the Oregon and Washington symbols lists since they have been promoted much more recently than the other three.

""""Too bad for you all the above were proven wrong by the scientific community"""" huh????? do u mean the Greek community?? cuz the last time I checked the Albanians wore proven to be linked to Illyrians,the last I checked the Albanian languange was and is Indo-European.
Guys a Arvanite that says I'am Greek its not a Arvanit but a Greek!The ancestors of the arvanites where Albanian farmers and highlanders from Toskëria and Epirus!My great-grandfather was Arvanit..Arbanitika belongs to the linguistic family of Albanian.The first Christian Albanian migrations to central and southern(note: Albanian of north-western Greece are on Albanian native lands) of what is today Greek territory took place as early as the XI-XII centuries (Trudgill, 1975:5; Banfi, 1994:19), although the main ones most often mentioned in the bibliography happened in the XIV-XV centuries, when Albanians were invited to settle in depopulated areas by their Byzantine, Catalan or Florentine rulers (Tsitsipis, 1994:1; Trudgill, 1975:5; Nakratzas, 1992:20-24 & 78-90; Banfi, 1994:19). According to some authors, they were also fleeing forced Islamization by the Turks in what is today Albania (Katsanis, 1994:1). So, some have estimated that, when the Ottomans conquered the whole Greek territory in the XV century, some 45% of it was populated by Albanians (Trudgill, 1975:6). Another wave of Albanian migrations took place during the Ottoman period, mainly in the XVIII century (Trudgill, 1975:6; Banfi, 1994:19). All these Albanians are the ancestors of modern-day Arbanites in Central and Southern Greece.

When the modern Greek state was formed, the Albanian-speaking population and its language were called Albanian .Bickford-Smith, 1993: 47; Embeirikos, 1994; Vakalopoulos, 1994:243-249). However, the policy of the new Greek state was to Hellenize all the non-Greek speaking Orthodox populations within its, then limited, territory as well as in the territories of Epirr, Macedonia, Thrace and Asia Minor still under Ottoman rule). As elsewhere in Europe, army and education were the most effective mechanisms of Hellenization, assisted by the judiciary system ready to denounce and punish all forms of behavior inconsistent with the state’s nationalist culture (Kitromilidis, 1990:38; Kollias, 1994).

In particular, has some criticism from people who are to MoveOn's left, something that is missing from the article as it stands. Among others, it quotes John Stauber to the effect that MoveOn has become """"primarily a money-raising and marketing arm of the Pelosi wing of the Democratic Party.""""

 (after ec) I do not understand your question as written, so I will simply explain UNDUE in a general way. Let's say, for example, we are writing about nails. An authoritative work about nails, written by an expert on nails, and used as a textbook, or source for a textbook about nails, would get a lot of weight - we would regard it as definitive. A differing view from a nail manufacturer's website would get considerably less weight, as would a newspaper article about nails. Finally, a politician or celebrity's comments about nails would get no weight at all, unless in their article, not the article on nails. And your cousin Bob's random comments on nails in his blog not only gets no weight, mentioning them on a talk page might be considered a violation of WP:FORUM. Giving a newspaper article the same weight as an authoritative text by an expert is a violation of UNDUE - you are giving a less important source undue weight. Applying this here, then medical texts on Abortion carry the most weight; other sources carry less and less weight the farther they move from authoritative sources. I hope this helps; if this does not address your question please try rephrasing. ?!?"

Eleland made a unilateral decision about all this and was quite perturbed when I reinstated the article. Eleland proceeded to get into a deletion war, would not entertain discussion prior to making wholesale deletions, and then contacted administration to have the sections struck out. Please check discussion for Admin's response. I do not question anything said by Manning, however it does not appear that he has looked at the sources as thoroughly as Fluri. Also Eleland placed warnings on the article regarding the veracity of the citations.

Admittedly, I have responded vigorously in discussion, but only to protect the material that had already been checked by Fluri. Anyway it appears that Eleland is on a messianic crusade to have it struck off the record. This is somewhat surprising given Eleland's herculean efforts to include material about Israel on the Caterpillar.Inc issue. Clearly Eleland is not the impartial arbiter that he would have us believe under """"Ed O'Loughlin"""" but a bit of an anti-Israel activist himself.

This is perhaps strange considering, and I quote Eleland in the discussion on Caterpillar Inc.: Editors must not remove information about an argument because they personally disagree with the argument. Wikipedia must include all notable points of view which appear in verifiable published sources. Reporting that activists have said something does not imply that the activists are correct. Removing those reports because you think the activists aren't correct contradicts Wikipedia's core policies. Eleland

Otherwise, they may stay on the list but, in the spirit of the WP policy on attribution to reliable sources, there should be a footnote attached to their name with a citation showing their local connection.

 Hate Crime 

I believe the category for hate crimes is acceptable and appropriate for the Jesse Dirkhising article. Rape is an act of hate and not an act of love.

 I think having wikipedia in here sounds like a good idea, at least because it seems to me that wikipedia is a very well-known example of free culture.

 The self-referencing seems ok, as the text says that writing about wikipedia is ok where it's relevant. If wikipedia is an example of online free culture, then it's relevant.
 As for wikipedia not using copyrighted material without permission, I don't see that as any stranger than FLOSS not gobbling up proprietary software. Free culture things are things that let you copy, distribute and modify them. Proprietary things generally don't, and so using them without permission isn't allowed, and therefore you can't include them in free culture things and have the free culture things remain free (or even legal).

It doesn't say in that book that the phenomenon that's occurring in Philadelphia is exactly the same thing as what's going on in Canada, so the allophone could be slightly different than that of Canada.

0,"From local anesthesia 

Text removed from local anesthesia which IMO might be better placed here, please review.  

Generally, a certain risk of local tissue damage is involved when using local anesthetics often and regularly during a longer period at a specific location of your body. For example, the chronic use of topical eye anesthetics in chronic eye pain would almost certainly and relatively quickly lead to serious eye damage (corneal damage).
Before using local anesthetics, chronic local pain should not only carefully be assessed with medical specialists for the local problem (for example an ophtalmologist, dermatologist, dentist or a neurologist/specialist for peripheral nerve blocks), but also by specialists for centrally active pain medication.
 Medical specialists (ophtalmologists, dermatologists, dentists or neurologists for peripheral nerve blocks) for the local problem can assess how big the risk of chronically using local anesthetics at that particular location is.
 In most cases of chronic pain, it is not the peripheral nervous system but the central nervous system that is not able to cope with the pain impulses coming from the location in the peripheral nervous system where the damage that causes the pain is actually located. Therefore, medical specialists for the central nervous system (usually a neurologist or pain specialist) can assess if and what kind of centrally acting medication can or should be taken. Very often, it is less harmful and risky to use centrally active substances (especially when they are only taken in low doses) against chronic pain in the peripheral nerve system than chronically using local anesthetics at a particular location of the body. Relatively risk free, especially when taken in small doses, and at the same time often effective against chronic peripheral pain are antidepressants of the SSRI class and the stronger tricyclic antidepressants like for example amitriptyline. Furthermore, modern anticonvulsants like pregabalin or gabapentin are relatively risk free and at the same time relatively effective against chronic pain, at least when taken in very low or low doses. One of the strongest and more risky options in the reduction of peripheral pain are anticonvulsants like carbamazepine. On the other hand, some other classes of centrally acting substances like for example opioids (they are unfortunately still often used in the treatment of chronic pain, including local pain in the peripheral nerve system) are extremely harmful and should be avoided in the treatment of chronic pain at all costs."

In Chinese Li means setup/erect, Chun spring/egg. Setup spring is a Chinese solar term, literally interpreted as erecting an egg for fun.

Are they saying that ones a Mexican crosses over the border he or she becomes white? that makes no sense. At what percentage does a mestizo become white, 50%, 75%, or 90%? According to the U.S census if a Mexican marks Mexican on the U.S Census, he or she will be classified as white. This leads to my final question, shouldn’t then most Mexicans be classified white, according to the CIA? Finally, I have been to several parts in Mexico and I have noticed that many, or the majority of Mexicans in central Mexico look whiter than Italians, French and middle eastern, which are classified as white everywhere. A large percentage of the Argentinean population has Amerindian mixture; doesn't that make them Mestizo's? Any ways, we will never know for sure until a large genetic sample is taken.

 Christian Slater's family tree 

Regarding edits to the article on Christian Slater, Oct 28 and 29 of 2009, I reversed your edit because:

The edit by 166.216.128.16 added mention of """"English and Irish descent"""", but also truncated the long standing paragraph on the fact that Helen Slater is no blood relation to him.  As you observed, the paragraph made no sense after that hack job.

In my opinion, the original paragraph touched on a point of interest, one that people might consult an encyclopedia to confirm or deny, and offered verifiable facts that attest to the extistence of a point of confusion (i.e. co-starring in """"The Legend of Billie Jean"""", and misinformation published on a DVD of """"Supergirl"""").

Now you have reversed my reversal.  I suspect you've done this in reaction to the mutilated version left by 166.216.128.16.  If you review the edit history between say Oct 26 and 29, and appreciate the original (and long standing) version of the paragraph, I leave it to you to bring the article back to that state again, as I'm loathe to reverse the reversal of my reversal.

Thanks for considering this.

  

 Censored Comments on Scorcese
I would appreciate it if you didn't delete my comments on talk pages for personal reasons. No editors were attacked and WP:BLP is for ARTICLES, NOT talk pages.   
Your statement """"there is a contingent of editors that feel the need to hide the fact that there are actually famous people in Hollywood that support child rape"""" is most certainly an attack upon a """"contingent of editors"""" which include the ones who have acted against your campaign to accuse multiple persons of supporting child rape, all the while ignoring the comments regarding reading the actual petition and trying to understand the actual difference between supporting Polanski's actions and protesting the manner in which he was arrested. And for the record, WP:BLP most certainly covers talk pages. See WP:BLP#Non-article space, which says """"Contentious material that is unsourced or poorly sourced and not related or useful to making article content choices should be deleted, and even permanently removed (""""oversighted"""") if especially problematic"""". Both your claim about editors' motivation and your statements against Scorcese are attacks. Please try to contain your bad faith.   

 You guys are delusional. I'm sorry that your celebrity hero worship blinds you to the fact that Roman Polanski raped a child and that is not okay. Maybe you should stop watching so many movies and go outside and watch the sun shine. It's not even worth it anymore. Have fun guarding your precious Hollywood articles from anyone that you slightly disagree with.   

No, delusional is thinking that because someone disputes the manner in which you present your viewpoint, it equates to being in favour of raping children, and that's not the first time you've made that type of comment.  That's delusional.  My disagreement with you is more than """"slight"""".   If I notice you make any comments that go against WP:BLP or that attack editors, I will revert them, but that is the only interraction I ever want to have with you.   Please do not leave any further messages on my talk page, and as long as you don't make any further inflammatory comments, I'll have no reason to bother you.

 Redirect from hoax page """"Hamlet of Denmark"""" 

Hello ! I just wanted to point out that the redirect that you created from Hamlet of Denmark should point to Prince Hamlet (which is the article dedicated to the character) and not to Hamlet. Best regards! (talk) 
 I thought about it, but the play also has King Hamlet, the ghost. (I have no preference either way; if you believe Prince Hamlet would have been a better target, I might reduce the protection for a while, so that you can change it.) -   
 Well, I confess that I have absolutely no idea about how to find whether people who search for """"Hamlet of Denmark"""" are more interested in the prince or in the king. I would say the prince, but it would be only a conjecture. Given the ambiguous nature of the expression, your choice seems the most reasonable. Sorry if I didn't give a better thought on it before contacting you. Cheers! (talk)

 Disney Channel Controversy 
On December 23, 2011, a rebroadcast of the episode """"Party It Up"""", where a female character complimented CeCe's brother, Flynn, with the line """"'I could just eat you guys up...well, if I ate"""" aired on the channel that evening. Former Disney Channel star Demi Lovato, who left Sonny with a Chance in the fall of 2010 for counseling because of personal issues, commented on the episode, criticizing the network through Twitter for including a joke about eating disorders when she had struggled through the issue herself, and as one of the reasons for leaving the company's fold. Disney Channel's public relations account responded to Lovato by stating that that episode and an episode of So Random! which had an eating disorder joke would be pulled from the network's airing cycle and reviewed further.https://twitter.com/#!/DisneyChannelPR/status/150418514426081281 Later in 2012, the episode started airing regularly on Disney Channel with the offending joke removed.
Disney Channel did not broadcast """"Quitting Cold Koala"""" on its originally scheduled date of May 17, 2013 and showed a rerun of """"Kids Don't Wanna Be Shunned"""" instead. The episode did, however, appear on the Disney Channel website, """"WATCH Disney Channel"""", and on """"Disney Channel On Demand"""", the channel's video-on-demand service. Disney Channel announced on their Facebook page """"We are removing this particular episode from our regular programming schedule and will re-evaluate its references to gluten restrictions in the character's diet"""". The edited version of """"Quitting Cold Koala"""" aired on July 5, 2013 as part of a 2 episode spectacular. All gluten jokes were removed in the revised version.
On January 28, 2014, Disney Channel announced that a TV episode of Good Luck Charlie will feature two lesbian moms in """"Down a Tree"""". This caused a protest from the conservative group """"One Million Moms"""" who told the Disney Channel company to not include it. Despite the protest, Disney Channel featured it anyway. Other people including actors Miley Cyrus and Evan Rachel Wood praised the episode and supported it."""

Please see this thread and consider giving new page creators some breathing room before tagging their pages for deletion. In this case, you tagged within 2 minutes of creation. Unless it's an attack page or something, give the editor some time to work with the article. Thanks, –xenotalk 
Admittedly I was on the fence in regards to this article and perhaps should have simply tagged it for improvement or as a stub. I allowed my review of the creator's block log to skew my opinion on an unreferenced bio. And I realize I misunderstood the inapplicability of G4's to speedy deletes.
But in general, as a NP patroller I feel that my purpose is to filter pages on creation.  With the volume of speedy deletes we generate, there are going to be occasional disputes regarding our reasoning.  However, in the vast majority these proposals for deletion are necessary soon after creation or the article will be lose the benefit of input from an experienced editor unless someone on recent changes happens to notice the article as it is being modified. If bad articles slip past this initial screening I feel it would increase the workload of the pool of editors as a whole.

 Why do procaryotic endospores get their own entry rather than being classified as a type of spore?  What is it about the definition of """"spore"""" that the bacterial kind doesn't meet?  Their sporulation and germination processes and triggering conditions are analogous to those of diploid eukaryotes, and the asymmetric fission leading to formation of an endospore is similarly analogous to that of the asymmetric division producing eucaryotic spores.

Paragraphs about major airlines retiring the 727

 Freedom House comment in introduction 

I deleted a paragraph in the opening of the article; this was promptly re-inserted by another user.  The text is: """"Israel is a democratic republic with universal suffrage that operates under the parliamentary system. According to the international data reported by Freedom House, the degree of political rights and civil liberties in Israel makes it the only liberal democracy in the Middle East, consisting of a multi-party system and separation of powers"""" 

I believe I had good reasons for removing it:

(1) The very same text - verbatim - is repeated later in the article.  This is reason enough for deleting it from the opening.  Without citing chapter and verse of Wikipedia policies, obviously a well-written article cannot be repetitious.

(2) A conclusionary statement about civil liberties is ipso facto a value-judgment.    This is obviously going to be endlessly controversial whatever the country involved (see point (3) below).  It is churlish to place this kind of comment right up there in the introduction.  Common/significant views about political rights are much better dealt with (less tersely) under the Government heading. I myself do not seek to contest the view that Israel has a high degree of political freedom, so if you disagree with me, deal with the point I make about the reasonableness of reporting this sort of evaluation in the opening of *any* country article.

(3) Where the very same text appears in the Government section, it is immediately followed by a contrary viewpoint, which the author(s) of this section thought was equally significant: """"Conversely, the research group Minorities at Risk (MAR) characterizes Israel's system ...""""  This gives a nice indication of how controversial the Freedom House opinion is, or at least appears to be to other Wikipedians.  Indeed, I'd like to ask: does the person who reverted my deletion of the same text from the opening think that its stupid to allign the Freedom House statement with opposing viewpoints (maybe because the Freedom House statement is 'incontrovertible', or whatever), and if so why did he/she not remove the 'Minorities at Risk' comment from the Government section?

(4) The text is a quote from Freedom House, which is widely regarded as a US-lead, organisation operating to promote a particular policy programme.  The Times (hardly a fringe opinion) has described it as an """"outpost of American soft power"""": .  Unlike, say, the Human Development Index there is hardly any global consensus support for its reports.  Giving its views such decisive prominence - treating them as the bottom-line on the country's political status by placing them in the opening - seems unencyclopaedic.  

I suggest that unless consensus forms against me on this, I should remove the offending text from the introduction.  There's presumably no objection to the same text being under the Government section (as it currently is - as well).

0,"While it may be true that there are thousands of trolls for Richard Kastle and Lang Lang... there is a huge difference. Although Lang Lang does (visually) look like an idiot when he performs with his weird facial expressions and over exaggerated face... he still happens to be a brilliant pianist (in the pieces where he doesn't decide to go 10 times the speed as directed.) 

Richard Kastle however as far as I (or many other people have tried) know has never had a single CD published or recorded. The fact that on the entirety of YouTube there is about 30 seconds of actual footage of Richard Kastle playing and a still shot of him on a Jay Leno show. 

Many of the so called 'trolls' that abuse Richard Kastle have a right to do so, due to the fact that a couple of psychologically disturbed people who praise him for being the greatest pianist of all time are truly wrong. There is also video footage on YouTube of a guy (who I believe is Kastle) discrediting major pianists such as Horowitz and Cziffra because they 'supposedly' simplified parts of their repertoire. This is completely NOT true due to the fact that University Professionals and other Professional Pianists would easily have picked up such a disregard for the music, in seconds. 

This article on Richard Kastle should be deleted due to the fact that it is just another excuse for one of those psychologically disturbed people who praise him for being the greatest pianist of all time, to brag about a man who does not deserve the credit he deserves. If it IS true that Kastle did actually discredit the great pianists - this page should be taken down for praising a slander who has the audacity to verbally abuse the good name and brilliant talent of the pianists who are deceased and have no way of discrediting this so called fraud called 'Richard Kastle'.

The simple direction difference between the negative and positive masses accelerations are not qualifiers for discrimination. There is no way, in a single reference frame, to distinguish the negative and positive masses - i.e. whether the earth is negative or positive mass and the object in question  is positive or negative. Further, the magnitude of the acceleration should be identical for each object.

I would suggest reading up on Hawking's idea (in his universe in a nutshell book) that mass energy + gravitational energy = 0. In essence, you can create all the matter you want, as long as it has gravitational pull which he regards as a negative energy. If this is the case, then there could, in fact, be negative mass with positive gravitational energy, which behaves in an opposite manner. I would presume that annihilation due to matter-antimatter interactions would have gravitational energy considerations as well - but in any case, the mere fact that negative mass would accelerate in a different direction in a gravitational field does not in itself preclude its existence, especially since gravitational laws were formulated without accounting for this eventuality."

The current full official names of the organization are simply Ezras Torah in Hebrew and Torah Relief Society in English as can be seen at http://www.ezrastorah.org/about_us.php and in their mailings.  

(Mossad) Ezras Torah was founded in August 1915 and was known by that name in numerous Yiddish and Hebrew news articles, advertisements and publications from the early 20th century.  Ezras Torah's own publications (see the links to the hebrewbooks.org documents on the wiki page) also mention just Ezras Torah without any addendum.  One can also see """"Ezras Torah Fund"""" without any additional title listed in page 45 of the following PDF document American Jewish Yearbook, 1921-1922 (Directories).
The organization was incorporated in early 1920 under the name Torah Relief Society.  The incorporation document can be found in New York City's Division of Old Records in Manhattan.

I can think of three possibilities re: """"for Relief of European and Palestinian Rabbis""""
1) The 1936 volume by Julius Caesar Schwarz was giving a description and not adding to the title
2) That book was in error
3) Ezras Torah had a different official name in the mid-20th century (this would need to be supported by official documents or from material published by Ezras Torah)

If either of the first two possibilities were correct then the later English language publications listed above might have just copied the lengthened organization name from earlier English language sources without consulting more authoritative sources.

0,"""What I was saying was that South Africa was never a """"black"""" country. The indigenous people were the Khoikhoi and the San(Capoids) who lived there for hundreds of thousand of years all alone. In the 15th century white Europeans arrived, and steadily built a civilization, dispossessing the native Khoisan. Only during the 18th and 19th centuries did the first blacks enter South Africa as settlers, invaders, and unwilling labourers. They outbred the indigenous Khoisan and the native whites to the point where the ruling white people who had built everything and anything resembling a civilisation or a modern state realised that they could lose their country to these non-indigenous people who rejected the very essence of that civilisation itself and refused to assimilate. So the official policy was apartness...apartheid. At the time everyone was happy with that, until millions more black people swet in, because their independent Black African states slid into Third World states in rapid succession. Meanwhile the local black population continued to have one of the highest birthrates in the world. The ANC, PAC, SACP etc were ALL funded by, and ruled from Soviet Moscow. The head of the ANC was never Tambo or Mandela, but rather East European Marxists. ALL weaponry, money, even idealogy came not from Soweto but Moscow. The obssessive terrorist war led to the end of white rule, and the rise of a FOREIGN-BORN black population who now represented the majority through relentless immigartion, murder, terrorism and an unnatural reproductive rate. At Mandela's inaugaration the Oppenheimers etc were there to let him know who was REALLY calling the shots. And since, """"independecne"""" and black rulse, South africa has deteriorated at a shocking rate. South Africa now has the highest murder, rape, armed assault, car theft, and child abuse statistics in the world. The HIV-infection and illegal narcotics statistics are rapidly catching up. The economy is approximately 15 % what it was under """"deliberate discrimination"""". There are massive blackouts every day, and the only people who are well off are the Marxist puppets who are the ANC, the druglords, and people who install security systems. That's part of what I meant.

Bad Agendas written in to this article
Hello folks, I'm not a wiki-writer.  I just use it from time to time.  But I am familiar with problems when some pages have points of view and agendas written in to them, and the American Civil War articles are rife with these problems.  You'd think the war was still on.  This article on the 43rd Battalion is generally very good, but someone has done their best to wreck the ship, nevertheless.  A paragraph in this article goes off-track and attempts to paint a picture that these soldiers were """"guerillas"""".  Anyone familiar with the writings of the war knows this word was used extensively and daily in newspapers, official US Army reports and accounts to refer to not just uniformed soldiers of the CS Army, but to any and all people of the South.  To discuss the use of this term in this article is a coy trick to insert an agenda, intended to disparage, vice simply communicate good Wiki information about this topic.  """"Guerilla"""" was so commonly used as a term in this war, that it cannot be said, at all, that this term applied to, or was used more commonly for any one unit or group in the war, than any other.  If editors continue to keep this slant and bias in the article, and contiue deleting other fair contributions which are neutral, then my comment here serves as a marker to future editors of the proof of the problem in this page, and the particular set of self-chosen watch-guards who intend to keep it here, while pretending they are not the root cause of the problem."""

 Problems in section Governance/subsection Law 

The following paragraph reads:

""""France does not recognize religious law, nor does it recognize religious beliefs or morality as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions. As a consequence, France has long had neither blasphemy laws nor sodomy laws (the latter being abolished in 1791). However, """"offenses against public decency"""" (contraires aux bonnes mœurs) or disturbing public order (trouble à l'ordre public) have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution. With such emphasis on public order, laws sentencing racism, sexism or antisemitism are also old and important. For instance, laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are as old as 1881.[93] Some consider however that hate speech laws in France are too broad or severe and damage freedom of speech.""""

This has to be removed, or at least re-written, because it is incorrect, and not supported by the source given. The fact that France does not recognize religious law is true, this can and should stay. The fact that is doesn't recognize 'morality' as a source of law is not. If so, why was adultery illegal until 1975?? Even worse, why were 'children born from adultery' discriminated in inheritance up until 2001(!), when France was forced to change its law by the European Court of Human Rights ?? In regard to sexism, which is addressed here - France was one of the last Western countries to recognize the rights of women - vote for women only in 1944, women could not work without the consent of husband until 1965, leniency for 'crimes of passion' under the Napoleonic Code etc. Let's not even open this subject... Also the source given does not support what the paragraph is saying, it only explains some laws against racism and antisemitism. I'm removing the paragraph.  """

Can you please explain your edits to Biff Rose? They appear to express a negative POV towards the person. - 06:55, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

 For willmcw 

I think its high time you stopped trying to rearrange my words. The information contained on the biff rose site colelcts the pertinent info. It is not a billboard for his achievements, but an overview of his career. I think records that were pressed and sold are of worth. Ones that were not around in copies more than fifty or a hundred are not. I've interviewed Rose, I know which ones sold and which ones didn't. You can beef up a discog with murky details, but it won't help the whole wiki crowd. Stop being bullheaded, and agressive, because though you've been given power through edits, you have also become that which you supposedly fight against. You are not allowing the newer versions of this piece to come to life, but instead are so closely guarding the information disseminated from within that you have become like a fascist. Terrible!!!

Why do you delete the number of """"Carson"""" appearances? Why are you deleting the name of his biggest song? What does it matter to you if the records sold 10 or 10,000 copies? Do you have some personal animus towards Rose? Please note that your personal feelings, and your personally-obtained interviews, should not be used to influence the article. It's a biography, and should present a comprehensive picture of his life. It's not a place to gain revenge on someone you don't like. - 20:21, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

I've copied this discussion to the talk:Biff Rose page. - 23:29, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

 Any info deleted was moved from prominence to more esoteric reading of it, to make the article read better, and have a decent flow. That Rose was in Time  magazine once in 1965 is not of note. That he wrote a song that was covered by both Tiny Tim and David Bowie is. That that song was co written Oscar winning musician Paul Williams is important. Also of note, it should be mentioned that Rose has disavowed the Williams connection in several interviews, until in late 2004 on his own website's message board he admitted he was falsefying William's own involvement in the song. But a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. As for Rose's appearnaces on Carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times Rose officially appeared on the show, and how many times he taped performances. He alleges, himself, that he appeared on the show 12 times. Producerss from the Tonight show remember him being on with much less regularity. Therefore, a distinction, to leave out embrassment, would be something like, """"Rose appeared with some level of regularity on the tonight show in the end of the decade."""" Of note> Rose was banned from any more performances on the Tonight Show because he refused to cut to a commercial break during his last performance, reciting a poem he often claimed as his own, which in fact was a poem by Paul Newman's uncle, Joseph Newman. This was chalked up to Rose's irrascible nature. I think it is important to notice to, the anger that first rears its head here, and then seems to pop up, on the record he did in 73, and beyond, to his later self released recordings where Rose is heard calling african americans niggers, and making fun of the jewish religion, citing Hit5ler as a genius, who clearly  had a vision. Willmcw is trying to keep the previous words someone else wrote about Rose being a child molester, which were clearly vandalism. I did not write that, and the anti semitic sentiments attributed to Rose are very easily found in his records and his websites. Willmcw is a vandal and works against my own edits in a nasty and un wiki fashion.

Sonic the Hedgehog (ソニック・ザ・ヘッジホッグ Sonikku za Hejjihoggu?), trademarked Sonic The Hedgehog,[2] is a video game character and the main protagonist of the Sonic video game series released by Sega, as well as in numerous spin-off comics, cartoons, and a feature film. The first game was released on June 23, 1991, to provide Sega with a mascot to rival Nintendo's flagship character Mario (see 1991 in video gaming).[3][4] Since then, Sonic has become one of the world's best-known video game characters, with his series having sold more than 80 million copies.[5] In 2005.

 many individuals at Sega had a hand in Sonic's creation, programmer Yuji Naka and artist Naoto Ōshima are generally credited with the creation of the character,[7] a blue 15-year-old anthropomorphic hedgehog, who has the ability to run at supersonic speeds and the ability to curl into a ball, primarily to attack enemies. This is a major part of the gameplay of the series."

Jim Heller here.  I tried to contact you before a few times but to no avail.  Sometimes I've just wanted to say hi, others I had a question concerning the early online ex-premie days.  I recall how one of the last things you told me before you bid adieu to the ex scene was that exposing Rawat felt at odds with your Quaker and ACIM beliefs and I assume you still feel like that.  Anyway, I trust you're well.  That picture on your website is the essence of happiness!

I'm bothering you now though, Scott, for a particular reason.  One of the premies editing the Prem Rawat article is alleging that the Mishler radio interview is a fake and I wonder if you'd be so kind as to drop in to that talk page and explain what happened.

Instead, the software used by Wikipedia has a feature that allows pages to be moved to a new title together with their edit history.

Considering the fact that this article was removed by a previous editor I just looked in the articles history and examined the latest edited form of the article before the changes were undone in order to complete my peer review.

The lead section provides a good stand alone summary of Chunking, in psychology.  The article already has a strong intro that didn’t require much editing in the form of adding new material. It did however, require some fine tuned modifications that I think she did a good job of locating and crossing out words and rephrasing sentences that needed to be more specific.  The contribution does not seem to be cut and pasted from an existing source it flows well with the article and is properly placed.   The terms used go along with the articles style well and are easy to understand.  One sentence that sounds a little confusing when read is “Runners may chunk the numbers into different relevant mile, or other distances, times.” May need a little more elaboration just to clear up the point you are trying to get across.  In the Short term memory section the sentence:  “The short term memory processes (stores) information for about twenty to thirty seconds”  I think needs a word or two added in, in order to complete the thought, I tried to include a suggestion.     May need a little more elaboration just to clear up the point you are trying to get across.  She relates to her references where it seems necessary.  Even though the article already includes a decent amount of information she finds the areas that did need further elaboration and creates an appropriate section for the information.  Grammar and verb tenses and spelling all match up well with the rest of the article.  One area where a wiki link may help the article is in the section where she is talking about short term memory, possible link to Short Term Memory but I don’t think that it is necessary, since she does explain it a little using a reference.  Her references match up well with the rest of the ones listed in the document in format and when investigating them, they all are relevant to the subject matter and provide useful information for the article.  I don’t think that any images would enhance the article, considering the article already provides a good diagram that is explained well and fits the topic nicely."

I'd respond to your query instantly except that I'm not going to make life easier for those (not you) who have twice reverted my edits to Dinosaur - if it were not for the reverts I'd have quietly corrected the item. But I've noticed your much more friendly and co-operative tone in our few discussions and the many well-earned congratulations in your Talk page, and I'll be very happy to co-operate with you on any other article if it is appropriate.   

Re Physiology of dinosaurs I'd be happy to contribute. I think I already suggested that the warmblooded/coldblooded debate should be a separate article - in fact Physiology of dinosaurs started life as """"Warmbloodedness of dinosaurs"""" and I was fairly happy that it was coherent and well-structured after my last edit under that title (although of course there was room for improvements). Physiology of dinosaurs looks the kind of article that will spawn further """"more details"""" articles as we find more material.

Re your suggestion of a """"Dinosaur behavior"""" article, I agree the relevant section of Dinosaur is getting too long. But I suspect (totally off the top of my head) that there's too much variation for one article when you consider differences in: time (150M years); size; lifestyle (predator / scavenger / browser / grazer); environment; and specific clades (although clade may not be a helpful grouping, look at lions and tigers). My inclination (off the top again) would be to handle this aspect bottom up, e.g. """"behaviour of dromaesosaurs"""", """"behaviour of large tyrannosaurids"""", """"behaviour of Jurassic sauropods"""", """"behaviour of large late Cretaceous ceratopsians"""" (bound to be different from that of smaller, earlier ones because the big, late ones had horns). Even working out how to structure a set of articles on this topic probably needs input from people with knowledge of specific groups / periods. But I'm game for it, as I think structuring a large set of related articles is a current weakness in Wikipedia (I'm involved in an attempt to remedy that in 1 subject area, History of IBM mainframe operating systems, see the Talk page). 

Re the conflicts, see User talk:Philcha#Dinosaur (period concerned is Jan - Mar 2007) and Talk:Dinosaur#Corrections_urgently_needed (21 Nov 2007). That's twice I've corrected errors in the article and had my edits reverted. In the earlier instance I pointed out the errors on Talk:Dinosaur and other defects and balance issues in Oct 2007 and nothing happened for 3 months. So I edited in Jan 2007 and my edit was reverted almost instantly. My current impression is that a certain clique thinks it owns that article and would rather revert edits not controlled by them than see the article improved by someone who's not a member of the clique and / or who (in the earlier instance) interprets Wikipedia guidelines differently from them. The more I look round Wikipedia the more places I can see where I can contribute, so I don't have time play games with such people.  ([["

Again from the Duel books pushing what was a politically driven firing trial in order to prove the quality of the armored plate.

Evidence provided by Carey Erickson concludes that the tests were politically motivated to artificially bolster the performance of the US 76mm gun over the 17 pounder gun which was unfairly  marginalized during the tests the Panthers themselves according to the researcher had significant battle damage (burned out, multiple hits, to front plate ,etc.) or were hit many times to lower the plate resistance before the tests were recorded. 

small excerpt:
  Panther Ausf. A tank labeled as No. 1 listed as having a good quality plate was in reality was face hardened (a curious rarity at this point of the war) and took 9 rounds to weaken the plate enough to allow penetration. Evidence also shows that the Panther tank No. 3 had serious battle damage before being subjected to the firing tests which should have excluded it from being tested in the first place. 

Therefore these tests are not an indication of poor quality Panther plate but rather an indication of the politics at the time I suggest a removal or an amendment informing the reader to the nature of the political nature of the tests."

Here are some concerns that I found in the article on a quick run-through:
 resolved Please make sure that the discussion regarding naming is completed and the decision is finalized with consensus one way or the other before you nominate for GA status.
 There are two citation banners in the article, both for lack of inline citations, and both were placed there several months ago.
 resolved There are several sections in the article (Working, utility and assistance dogs, Show and sport (competition) dogs, Dangerous substances) that are composed almost completely of lists.  MOS discourages lists in articles, so these should be turned into prose as much as possible.
 There are a lot of short sections in the article.  For as many of these as possible, please either expand them or combine them with other sections.
 resolved There shouldn't be external links in the body of the article as there are at the end of the Ancestry and history of domestication section.  Instead, these should be turned into references, moved to the external links section, or removed altogether.
 The article needs quite a bit more referencing.  For example, in the Ancestry and history of domestication section, six out of seven paragraphs are completely unreferenced.
 Make sure that all of your web references have publishers and last access dates.  Also, please make sure that you are actually using the publisher, and not the work.  For example, with current ref #41 (The Case for Tail Docking), the publisher should be Council of Docked Breeds, not cdb.org.

 About the topic ban of Wilhelmina Will from DYK 

I've been trying to figure out what happened with the AN/I report that led to a topic ban for WW. Normally, when the community makes a decision that requires admin tools to implement or enforce, there is a closing administrator. I've reviewed the report and have summarized it at User:Abd/Will ANI incident (at this point, this is a long summary, not a short one, I will prepare a short version if it's later needed.) And I just realized that there never was a close to that report, which explains why WW wasn't informed, that would normally be a task undertaken by a closing admin. Now, you later described the report as a consensus to topic ban, and you did inform WW, but you reported it passively, as if it had not been your decision, you were just the messenger.

I easily understand how it happened, and assume nothing but good faith on your part, but there was a fundamental error here. The community does not make decisions by vote. Rather, it uses agents, public servants, who make decisions after review of community comment, but the servants are responsible for reviewing the arguments, and vote count isn't the issue except as a very rough guide, and I've seen many decisions, made by highly competent administrators, which ran directly contrary to a large majority of votes, based on a review of the arguments.

So I'm asking you if you did this. Did you review the arguments and decide that they were cogent and that a topic ban was in the best interests of the project. If you did not, would you do so now and """"close,"""" i.e., take personal responsibility for the decision? In which case you could then inform us as to the length of the ban, or any other conditions imposed. And there would then be, if another administrator wishes to lift the ban, a responsible admin to contact?

I will tell you that my now much more detailed review of the facts leads me to the conclusion that a ban wasn't justified at all, there was no disruption at DYK from Wilhelmina Will, and there was very minor misbehavior elsewhere which only gets connected with DYK because of her presumed motive. A general conclusion from those who understand DYK seems to be that there is nothing wrong with the motive, and that what WW did was simply some minor foolishness, of a kind that would normally pass almost unnoticed, and which she has not continued. So, in spite of her seeming disregard of warnings, she clearly hasn't disregarded them, she just quietly complied. Yes, she should learn to respond, it would help. But I have never seen a response to a warning as being a condition for not blocking. The procedure is Warn. Wait for repeated offense. Block if repeated. Not Warn. Wait for promise to comply. Block if no promise.

There were several issues raised:
Mesodermchelys misbehavior: short term, over one or two days, 2 improper reverts to preserve word count. 3 edit summaries that express her personal reaction to Blechnic  which, after reviewing what he had done, I fully understand and sympathize with. She was foolish to make those edit summaries, but it wasn't disruptive, and it wasn't personal attack within the meaning given at WP:NPA, whereas she was under repeated PA within that meaning: an attempt to damage her reputation.
Copyright violations. Evidence was requested at ANI, but none was provided, links were given by Blechnic that showed nothing of the kind. He is now attempting to build a case on his Talk page  he now refers to all of her edits as crap, later amended to vandalism  and what he cited was a sentence in a seven-month-old article which, it turns out, she had noticed in the Sandbox and asked an admin if she could use it, and she failed to check for copyvio. The sentence was a direct copy. Maybe. Or was it that a web site later took the sentence from Wikipedia? I certainly don't know. Easy to fix. No pattern shown.
Incivility. But the example given, as far as I recall, was always back to the Mesodermochelys incident. And then reference was made to her lying about it, claiming that her leetspeak comment was really a note to herself about something else. This was a clumsy excuse that simply shows that she is naive. And which was harmless, except to her own reputation.
Accuracy of her articles. She has made mistakes. However, what I've seen with WW articles on scientific subjects is that, particularly if they are DYK nominated, whatever errors are in them are rapidly fixed. The articles aren't an obstacle to the creation of accurate content, rather they facilitate it, particularly by being DYK nominated. In other words, if there is, in fact, a problem here, DYK is part of the solution, not part of the problem. But, in fact, her articles are much better than the average new article on Wikipedia.

Prameswara is indeed a common Sanskrit name. Prameswara is also incontrovertibly Indonesian, whether he was Sumatran or Javanese  is unclear- but he was definitely born in Sumatra int the court of Sriwijaya- not as the article states, in Temasek- which would make Prameswara a fisherman's child.
Islam arrived in Indonesia from Persia, Punjab and Gujarat- not China. Zheng He was a Hamafi muslim, not a Sufi. The earliest Muslim graves in Java proper date from 1368 (Banten) -1400 in Trowulan, the capital of Majapahit in the same complex as the cenetries of the highest nobility- which indicates the highest strata of Javanese society had already began to convert, predating the Eunuch Turkoman Hamafi Zheng He. Thus the ludicrous argument CHinese as part of the Wali Songo brought Islam to Java is disproved by archeological evidence.

You will also note- the Javanese repelled the Mongols- the only other Asians to successfully do so were the Japanese. Zheng He's navy was a navy for prestige and tribute- not a military navy. The Javanese under Singhasari later Majapahit also repelled the Siamese, and the Negerakertagama epoic already indicates there was Muslim activity or unrest in pre-Zheng He Java. I have not read of any Zheng HE military campaign.

I have been here almost two years and I think there is a lot to be done when it comes to securing NPOV on Albanian related articles.

 Lying comes too easily to you Mr.Kannambadi 

Mr.Kannambadi, 

Do you know that your attitude is also an equal put off to those who wish to contribute genuinely to wikipedia, engage in healthy discussions and arguments?  It is obvious that trusting you to be sincere in your approach and thinking you to be respectful of fellow contributors, I come up with explanation, sometimes or many a times in detail about historical events. Mind you the expression detailed in victory and silent about defeats was the one given not by me but by you to Nishkid. 

Also, do not resort to blatant lying on these pages (which you are clearly doing, first by saying that I have no sources - be realized that others can also read and write - and second, you are deliberately with malafide intentions creating a misimpression in wikipedia that I was banned for abusing and lack of sources. Be informed that it was neither of those reasons, because the first time I was blocked by Blinguen, it was completely and absolutely without any reason and the second time Blinguen came into my page, he did not express any objections to my contributions or changes to the Chola page, but first he commented that he is blocking me for he thought my contributions were my personal opinions and because he blocked me, he first of all did not engage in any discussions with me or try to explain as to how to make postings in the right manner (though I had indeed sourced the material properly but had not referenced the same) with the result that I got blocked before getting to discuss or even adding the necessary references or citations.  But it is good, this way you are only exposing yourself displaying your lack of spirit of accommodation.

I think I have put it as succinctly as one can, but what can you do, you will go on yapping I am writing detailed messages and creating confusion and what not?  Do you remember the manner in which you so very contemptuously retorted upon my providing even the weblinks like visitchitradurga.com, unnecessarily resorting to instructing about keeping one’s patriotism under control…. That is the problem with people like you, when people give reasons you come up with such unhealthy excuses, when people want to discuss history instead of talking about sources and citations, you tell them to keep their patriotism under control or start alleging that what we try to contribute are devoid of sources or are straightaway our personal opinions. How wrong can you be?  Well, that’s how some people like you are in this world!!!

So your way is pretty clear; either avoid any discussion, remove postings and contributions or cry and complain behind the back, get people blocked and start blaming them by speaking and spreading all sorts of lies.

The next time you want to speak about somone abusing, pl. recall with all vigour in what manner you retorted to Mahawiki - you told him first not to """"soil"""" your talk page (what language and choice of words!!! and then you told him to go get the book by S.Kamat from a good library because you said such a library exists near your home..... if those are not insults, abusive manner of speaking, then what is.... but poor you, when I asked you to go and read Ancient India by either Roychowdhury or Sastri, you start looking out of the balcony!!!!!!

tsk tsk..

  

 Who is a vandal, Mr.Dinesh Kannambadi 

Do not accuse others of being vandals.  Because Ninlil's intervention did not seem partial to you, you have resorted to getting the page 'blocked from edits in the garb of it being an FA category (howsoever inaccurate' by Yellowmonkey.

Now whom should the question be asked: whether it is appropriate to mention the demise of the Cholas along with the demise of the Chalukyas, when it is clearly known to everyone that the Chalukyas first remained without a capital for over 30 years up to 1160/65 and finally demised in 1189/1192 AD with the Cholas lasting another 9 decades before being routed and finally eclipsed by the Pandiyans in 1279 AD?. This is simply because there is no relationship between the demise of the two kingdoms, the Cholas did not cause extinction of the Chalukyas or vice versa. The demise of the Chalukyas does not deserve mention in the Chola page because even though the Cholas existed, but mainly because the Chalukyas were consumed and finally eclipsed by their local rivals in Kannada country as well as by the Kakatiyas.  Then what could be the reason for mentioning the demise of the Cholas, when it was the Chalukyas who demised many, many years before them? Is it some sort of a new version of history that is being sought to be told and spread to unsuspecting visitors to these pages?

I believe that trolling is an important part of any wiki, and without people who are willing to creatively challenge accepted assumptions and groupthink a community may stagnate or fail to maximise its opportunities. Many people who say they are against 'trolling' are actually, when you talk to them about it, against vandalism, personal attacks or timewasting, none of which I condone. I think that w e need to be more tollerant of different approaches as a community, and more willing to try to understand each other - in that way we can build the best encyclopedia possible.

Seems like you got confused with pro-Hindustani editors. Here is 65 year old statement: 

Article 351. Directive for development of the Hindi language- It shall be the duty of the Union to promote the spread of the Hindi language, to develop it so that it may serve as a medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India and to secure its enrichment by assimilating without interfering with its genius, the forms, style and expressions used in Hindustani and in the other languages of India specified in the Eighth Schedule, and by drawing, wherever necessary or desirable, for its vocabulary, primarily on Sanskrit and secondarily on other languages.
http://rajbhasha.nic.in/UI/pagecontent.aspx?pc=MzU=

Hindi emerged as Apabhramsha, a degenerated form, in the 7th century A.D. By the 10th century A.D., it became stable. 'Braj, Awadhi, Khari Boli etc are the dialects of Hindi'. The present literary standard of Hindi is based on 'Khari Boli'. Hindi became the official language of India after 1947
http://hindinideshalaya.nic.in/english/hindi_orgin/briefhistory.html

Where are other languages of India ? What about Braj bhasha, Khadi Boli, Awadhi, Chattisgariya  ? They can call Hindi as much as Urdu speaking people are calling Hindi as Hindustani. The Hindi I speak has more Punjabi & English words than Urdu. The list goes on.

65 years are more than enough to change a language. We know that Hindi of 1960s is not same as Hindi of today. Even Indian English has emerged as major L2 speakers of English in last 65 years."

I am not fabricating original research as it is all already in the article. It would be appropriate if you were to provide sources contradicting their occupation of such areas within those dates if the article is wrong. As for the lines drawn, as far as I've seen in books they are only used to show the movement of armies in detailed books of military campaigns and are never shown on a map depicting the extent of a kingdom. As mentioned before due to the other articles following such a rule the border should enclose Pataliputra as an occupation period of 8 years is enough I think especially if many other pages include territories that have been held for only a year and these articles (mentioned above) have been peer reviewed."

Actually, I am pretty sure for example Maris Verpakovskis real name is like that, because """"Maris"""" is even Latvian name. At least here in Lithuanian there are both Russians who uses their names as they'd use in Russia and who uses lituanised versions (with endings """"as"""" or """"is""""). Out of Russians who uses lituanised names, many are second or third generation; sometimes parents decides to give children lituanised version of name and surname in those cases, it happens especially in mixed families. E.g. one of Lithuanian football team players is Igoris Morinas; it would be wrong to change it to Igor Morin because Igoris Morinas is his real name. While, for example, real name of the mentioned poolitician is Viktor Uspaskich, not Viktoras Uspaskichas, therefore Viktor Uspaskich is and should be used (and is used that way in Lithuanian wikipedia too). As for Latvian football team, I am not really sure though, but I am sure that for example Verpakovskis is not Mariy Verpakovskiy or something. Maybe someone could shed more light on Latvian policy on names, maybe in Latvia it is different than here in Lithuania, or maybe Latvianisation of name is for example required to get citizenship?

 Feature Designation Code  Name                                  Text ADM1  first-order administrative division   a primary administrative division of a country, such as a state in the United States ADM2  second-order administrative division  a subdivision of a first-order administrative division ADM3  third-order administrative division   a subdivision of a second-order administrative division ADM4  fourth-order administrative division  a subdivision of a third-order administrative division ADMD  administrative division               an administrative division of a country, undifferentiated as to administrative level

The NGA leaves the definitions (""""Text"""" in the above table) of ADMs 2-4 """"intentionally vague... All we attempt to identify with the ADM is the hierarchical structure, and if there is no hierarchy, then the level of importance or size (with ADM1 being the largest).""""

In a table of global country subdivisions, would you expect all those entities found in a particular column (i.e. at a particular level) to be similar in """"importance or size"""" – presumably where """"size"""" might mean area or population...?

 Dhudhi Family 

The Dhudhi are a tribe of Panwar Parmar Rajput origin, who numbered 5,800 according to the 1931 census of India.
The Dhudhi have traditions of migration from Malwa in Central India. Dhudhi, the ancestor of the tribe was said to be a kinsman of Panwar ruler Raja Bhoj of Ujjain, and said to have migrated with his family to Punjab..
History
This is a clan of Panwar Rajputs found along the banks of the Sutlej and Chenab. They are supposed to have come originally from Multan. They are said to be """"fair agriculturists and respectable members of society"""".

The original seat of the tribe was Mailsi in Vehari District, where they are mentioned as early as the first half of the 14th Century. 

One of them, Haji Sher Mohammad was a saint whose shrine is in Multan Division in District Burewala Mouza Dewan Sahib is still renowned.
Famous Muslim saint Shah Hussain renowned as Madhu Lal Hussain also belongs to this clan.

0,"Honestly the way wiki is treating this is a JOKE

a. I could have cited NEWS SITES but since when is a news site worthy of an academic cite?

b. if the person that wanted PEER REVIEW felt like it, he would have sought it 20 years ago, HE CHOSE NOT TO DO IT, but none the less his work is known and was mentioned in many math related 'forums' and most ignored it. 

c. Only the recent 2012 open source test of the work PROVED the 30Mod algorithm is a major thing in math, again, GITHUB is a programmers resource and it was not until a computer used the actual 30Mod algorithm that it was shown to be a 'big thing' and since then some news sites have covered it, but I chose not to cite them due to IMO they are not NPOV. But none the less they covered the story.

d. The FACT is a major computer site where programmers have free reign to challenge any claims exists and for over two years not one programmer challenged the findings.

e. so what if the person that discovered it works outside of academia and has no regard for normal 'peer review' the fact is he has no peers if you ask some in academia that know of his work, and I am one of those people that know of the work and how brilliant the work is.

Now to summarize, we have a bunch of pags about primes on wiki, and even pages created after his discovery that USE his discovery (ie. the sieve of Atkin 60Mod work is his work discussed in the public forum and usenet math and physics forums is where he chose to discuss his amazing work.

So now you have 2004 sieve of Atkin using a 60Mod algorithm, guess what that was in his 1995 paper. So does wiki acknowledge that? No. And i didn't even bother to waste my time of the 60 mod algorithm since the big deal as you are saying is the PyPrimes test and I cited that very well, it's a program created in Python, I cited the wiki python page, then I cited Github for both PyPrimes and the PyPrimes testing.

Now while MATH is m forte, I am sufficient enough in computer skills to understand what Github is and to understand how to read the speed tests and the prime spirals smoked every algorithm there is. Now anyone can download python (which I have done) and download pyprimes (which I have done) and run the tests. Guess what just like a math experiment, it is duplicated.

So GITHUB and the tests which are not 'new' should be enough to begin a wiki page on this truly amazing discovery in math.

I myself became aware of the first paper in 1995, as did others in aademia. Recently I became aware of 'news sites' running stories citing what I copied, the links to the Github tests.

While some here can say well it's not AMA, so what, in the world of primality testing primes spirals as per the PyPrimes results shows PRIME SPIRALS are a big deal.

Now I tried to be NPOV in giving all sides of the story, Adoni has a valid 1995 claim I can verify it and I chose not to. But I cited a Drexel Math forum and I could have cited many other math sites discussing his 30mod, 60mod and 90mod prime work in the 1990's. Is this signficant? You bet it is since 60Mod prime sieve aka Atkin sieve is 20004 so his 60mod prime work is well before it.

Now the Github tests mentions 'croft spirals', that's due to in 2010 a person named croft registering a web site and ripping off the 1995 work. MY OPINION.

Now Croft can say all he wants that he found it playng his guitar or whatever he is claiming.

The fact is anyone can document Adoni with Prime theory from the 1990's saying 30mod, 60mod and 90mod is the key.

9 Years later sieve of atkin appears, well that's only a rehash of the adoni 60mod work from the 1990's. Yet no one is giving him credit.

2010 croft puts out his 30Mod work and its inserted into PyPrimes on Github and it smokes every major prime algorithm there is and all of them have pages on wiki as I cited.

So 2012 a work on Github verifies how important to primality the 30mod spirals are, but he says croft spirals, well guess what HelixQ is now out there and taking 100% credit for the 1995 work of Dr. Adoni.

My site to a Drexel math site from the 1990's mentioning 30Mod prime work (prime spirals) is a major cite, since Adoni could care less about the AMA or whatever, in all probability he will soon be nominated for a Nobel on his work, that is how important it is. 

Think about it, not one prime algorithm could beat the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, none of them. On a computer creating primes all other algorithms are terribly slow. The only two fast generators from scratch are the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes and the PRIME SPIRALS, and the winner was Prime Spirals. Now I can cite recent news articles about it, laughing at academics it links to that said it was no big deal in the 1990's who now all look foolish due"

 Edison Movie reference - 1940 

I just heard a bug reference in the movie - Edison, The Man (1940) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison,_The_Man - towards the end of the movie when Edison determines that his two dynamos have a problem because the speed governors were not synced until he mechanically linked them. 

His first erroneous attempt caused the dynamos to act as a motor/generator combo until the governors were mechanically linked. He wanted the dynamos to work as parallel generators. In the movie, Spencer Tracy distinctly used the term """"bugs"""" for this problem when he first attempted to light up New York City.

Granted, this is a movie. But the term """"bug"""" was obviously used during Edison's invention period for mechanical design issues that needed to be resolved and thus included in the movie. Re-quoting the previous Edison quote - [""""Bugs"""" — as such little faults and difficulties are called]. And the movie itself is from 1940, which is earlier than when it was first used for software. It seems likely that """"bugs"""" was an engineering term before it made it into software."""

WHERE DID I EVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT NAKHICHEVAN POPULATION IN 1830s, do you see me ever contesting those statistics? Do you even see me contesting 14th century material? Besides, Nakhichevan discribed there is NOT Nakhichevan with its current bordering. Grandmaster, don't get offended but up to now you have demonstrated that you have no clue of what you are talking about. Taking Nakhichevan as a whole, in its pick, the population jumped to 150,000, it was its most important period, after the 13th century it was replaced, in 14th century, it droped to about half of its prior population, it lost its statue, at 15th century it was taken over by Armenians from the vicinities of Van, and after the desertion of Ani, people moved there. Julfa alone represented a significant portion of the entire population. The closest to the Abbas period you cam is of over 200 years, while I provided data which covered that period. You are the one making up things which you can in no way backup. Here, let readd the materials I have provided.

For the next four centuries, Armenians, who had begun their dispersion after the fall of Ani and the Seljuk Turkish invasions in the eleventh century, continued to emigrate. In the meantime, Persia ( Iran) experienced a revival under the Shi'i Safavids, who became the adversaries of the Sunni Ottomans. From 1501 until 1639, the two fought each other periodically in Armenia. Armenians were uprooted during these wars, and, in 1604, some 250,000 Armenians were forcibly transferred by Shah 'Abbas to Iran. By the seventeenth century, the Armenians had become a minority in parts of their historic lands. The merchants of Julfa in Nakhichevan were among those who were brought to Iran by Shah 'Abbas; he moved them to a suburb of Isfahan where they built the New Julfa community. The support of 'Abbas and subsequent shahs enabled the Armenians to expand Iran's trade with India, China, Russia, and Western Europe. These merchants helped to make the Persian Gulf an important trade center. An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires by James S. Olson, Lee Brigance Pappas, Nicholas C. J. Pappas. p. 44

Shah Abbas devastated his frontier areas, which included parts of Armenia, as a defensive measure and so displaced nearly all the population. [from it] He settled some 13,000 families in the silk-growing northern provinces of Gilan and Mazanderan bordering on the Caspian. (Source: The Armenians and the East India Company in Persia in the Seventeenth and Early Eighteenth Centuries by R. W. Ferrier, The Economic History Review, New Series, Vol. 26, No. 1 (1973), p. 39)

Linda K. Steinmann in her work Shah 'Abbas and the Royal Silk Trade 1599-1629, Vol. 14, No. 1 (1987), pp. 68-74 covers the evacuation of the Armenians, and to a lesser extent elsewhere of Georgians, but nowhere does she say anything about any evacuation of Tartars.

Ina Baghdiantz McCabe covers the evacuation in her work The Shah's Silk for Europe's Silver: The Eurasian Trade of the Julfa Armenians in Safavid Iran and India (1530-1750), I don't see anything about Tartars being evacuated or an undiscriminate evacuation, or any reference of an important Tartar population in Nakhichevan.

Josepho Barbaro while visiting the devastation reports destruction of Armenian towns and its desertion, not Tartars.

Sir William Ouseley during his visit in 1812 has only discribed the destruction of the Armenian city during the evacuation.

In 1603 Shah 'Abbas, the great Safavid ruler of Persia, sent an expedition into Armenia in answer to the appeals of the inhabitants for assistance against the Turks. The death of the Sultan Mahmud III in December 1603 and the succession of his son Ahmed, a boy of twelve, opened the way to an easy conquest in the course of which both retreating Turks and invading Persians plundered the Armenians. The Persian victory was followed by a forced emigration of the population to the Shah's capital of Isfahan. « That dragon of hell, Shah Abbas, nourished from the beginning in the ways of the serpent, saw with an eye of envy the prosperity of the Christians. » So Arakel of Tauriz, the seventeenth-century Armenian historian, puts it, and it was indeed the skill of new... Armenia was left desolates... (A Seventeenth-Century typological cycle of paintings in the Armenian cathedal at Julfa, T. S. R.

First I'm a little obsessive with unfounded criticism. Sorry about that, It makes me long-winded. I'm not at all obcessive  with this topic- which I could give two deuces about- once it is properly sourced and defined.  

User:Brangifer has a lot to say about me.  Perhaps one example of unreliable sourcing as described to show good faith? It shouldn't be difficult. I assumed good faith and ask for one example, never got.  No shred of anything to indicate good faith on his part except a WP:policy-based assumption. Is it an assumption of bad faith to ask for proof or evidence that should not be difficult to provide? Is is bad faith not to provide it? It not a search warrant I'm seeking.  He implies I have a pattern of it.  I have seen zero evidence to the contrary, so as far as I'm concerned, to me his edit make him comes across as a full-blown, straight-up liar.   

Read that carefully as I didn't say he is a liar (name-calling). It's just that without one specific example for his accusations against me, he surely come across as one with his recent edit. I've been assured this is not an attack and is an acceptable use.

""""What you have provided on the article talkpage has been viewed by other editors as advocacy of a conspiracy theory.""""  
Let me get this straight,  Rule#1 is that A conspiracy theory can have no evidence. Rule#2 There is none to have that's even remotely related. Rule#3 So none can be considered.  
It's a made up theory. However, (paranoid) people's crazy theories are usually based on some remote kernel of truth.  Kernels of truth in wild theories have documentation. It does not validate the theory and there is not reason not to consider current beliefs against past history. The source says 1970s which I pointed out, gets added to the entry, source disappears. WP is full of rule followers who can't think logically or realize when they are being made to lay down in the $hit sources they picked for themselves.

I provided public domain information documented by and available from unimpeachable sources as a hey look at this and tell me if it's it related to this subject (It is).  Then the accusations start.  Unfounded ones. 
I'm not advocating for any conspiracy. Not one of those four links did either.  The info was 40-50 years old.
Seen as advocacy of a conspiracy? 
Which conspiracy? 
And which other editors?  
Problem with sourcing? Which source?    
I need an example to show good faith.  This is not court but show me that the accusations have merit. With out one example, It proves they knew what they said about me they knew to be untrue. The concerns mentioned are made up any without any merit. Hence- the lie. 

It is a personal attack because I told him that these accusations were offensive to me, yet it continued.  My exact words were """"To accuse me of being a believer in this crap is offensive to me and is taken as personal attack."""" I told this person numerous times that I am not a believer yet he continues to accuse me of being some nutjob is an attack.  """"Believers"""" don't cite reliable verifiable unimpeachable sources or say the theory is complete BS. 

Posting that my sourcing is bad when there is nothing to show that, is an attack. It was not in good faith. It's made up because not one example can be provided to substantiate it or the good faith intent. If it was good faith, one example should have been able to be provided in order demonstrate and substantiate his good faith. If we had that, there never would have been a problem with what was said.  The comment is simply untrue as I've stated and he knew it. This is no difference of opinion as he has characterized it.

Look at it from my point of view, Would you like if I said?  
Go edit somewhere else. 
You are a full blown believer and pusher of the chemtrail conspiracy theory and your use of unreliable sources to do it doesn't exactly help your credibility?

If I have zero evidence how can I say it in good faith or without attacking you? 
You've said """"Baldly stating that another editor who has commented in good faith is a liar is unequivocally a personal attack, and is not tolerated."""" How else does one responded to a bald-faced lie?
A barefaced (or bald-faced) lie is one that is obviously a lie to those hearing it.

My intent, since I came upon this piece o' crap entry was to hold other editors' feet to the fire to ensure good sourcing.  The entry needs definition and the current one is based on Stieg.  There is a source that has been in use for (7?) years that each of these expeienced editors have insisted on using and reverting back to. Rather than hold feet to fire -because no one will let m"

Well it looks like you others who have an account added the rat factoid, what with it explaining the ending.

Finally, and this is towards Ctjf83 and Momusufan, I freely admit that I am no expert about the bureaucratic nature of and rules of this site.

OK, no reordering. But can we give them designations, like this? I'm calling it """"List A"""" so we can start a new list later without confusion. If you don't like it we'll work something else out, but we really need some way to refer to issues without saying, """"Hey, getting back to that thing we were talking about, the bit where it says that Gage was traveling, not the bit about the time when he blah blah blah.""""

One point: we absolutely cannot refer to """"Note X"""" and """"Ref 22"""" and so on. These designations shift around as the article is edited and we will go completely crazy. In the below, I've substituted permalinks instead. 

Issues list """"A""""

A1 Background
A1a """"He may have gained skill with explosives on his family's farms or in nearby mines and quarries..."""" Speculation from Macmillan. Attribute it.
A1b Gage's date of birth in the infobox is not covered here when it should be covered and noted in proper context of its sourcing.

A2 Gage's accident
A2a Does not address numerous theories presented or Gage's actions prior to accident. EEng knows all too well this subject. I think Ratiu and Van Horn's material needs to be pointed out because the evidence shows that Gage had his mouth open and was speaking at the time the rod passed through his skull. I do not know why this is absent. I have issues with the section, but I'll hold off on the excessive quoting and measurement issues for now.

A3 Subsequent life and travels
A3a """"bt. February he was able to do a little work abt. ye horses & barn, feedg. ye cattle &c; that as ye time for ploughing came he was able to do half a days work after that & bore it well."""" - Paraphrase.
A3b  Would Gage's mental impairment belong here? I think it would be helpful.
A3c  Missing Gage's time in New Hampshire prior to Chile.
A3d  Chile and California is missing the account of Gage's doctor and missing some other tidbits, not too bad - but everything related to his mental improvement and the regaining of normalcy in his life is absent without reason.
A3e This is also the key section that Macmillan's research becomes quite useful as a case argument.

A4 Death and subsequent travels
A4a  Still glaringly missing the details surrounding his return home, illness and death. 
A4b Also, the exhumation details - which was in Fleischman's book - is entirely absent. This little episode in the Gage story is something which is important. 

A5 Other matters
A5a Analysis and actual examination of the claims and details surrounding Gage and his role in science has been well- mostly avoided by the article. Instead of proper detailing of the injury and Gage's role in history. 
A5b Only a few hundred words on Gage's mental impairments were written yet lengthy quotes are used.
A5c Using """"passim"""" and other issues in citing Macmillan is also a cop-out and would merit a verifiability failure.
A5d Not even that, it doesn't even credit Macmillan when it should.

A6 Notes
A6a A substantial part of the text is hidden away in these notes. These complex, rambling, and citation filled messes that only make verification more tedious.
A6b A note like  which reads """" See Macmillan & Lena;[34]:9 Harlow;[12]:332,345 Bigelow;[11]:16–17 Harlow;[9]:390 Macmillan.[1]:86"""" is just improper.
A6c  Note  - """"Macmillan's book provides one of those rare occasions on which one can truly say that further research is not necessary ... the definitive account ...""""[57]"""" - is just the type of note we do not need.

A3c For Gage's time in New Hampshire, didn't he spent 18 months in a horse stable?

The article says
Gage subsequently worked for the owner of a livery and coach service in Hanover, New Hampshire
Harlow says this began sometime in 1851 and, """"He remained there, without any interruption from ill health, for nearly or quite a year and a half."""" This fits with JMH's (JHM = John Martyn Harlow) information that PG went to Chile in August 1852. How about if we change it to 
For about eighteen months he worked for the owner of a livery and coach service in Hanover, New Hampshire
Thoughts?   

A4a missing details surrounding return home, illness and death

""""but he was in Chile for about 7 years, correct? Then he returned and rested for awhile before becoming a farm laborer - I'm not sure if this is on one or several farms, but wasn't the convulsions following a day's labor on the farm? The seizures"

They've forgotten what Jimbo so clearly stated at his user talk page """"I think there's a pretty strong case to be made for """"Climategate"""" as the name for the article, as it is clearly the most common name in the press for this.

(This is not a decree, but my point is that it is pretty obvious that - contrary to the wild claims of coverup and so on - we do have a well-sourced article that is comprehensive and informative and fair... but with a pretty silly title that no one uses. The scandal here is clearly not the """"hacking incident"""" - about which virtually nothing is known.

This page is redirected from russian peasant multiplication, but a google search for the exact phrase russian:peasant:multiplication scores 570 and peasant:multiplication only 689. To me this implies that it is nearly 5 times as likely to be refered to as russian peasant multiplication in english. Moving the page is not really worth while, but a recognition of the alternative name in the text seems to make sense to me.

On the subject of the proposed merge with ancient egyptian multiplication, the two techniques, while relying on the same fundemental mathematical principal, are very different in practice. These multiplication schemes are specifically about practice, not theory. The people that use/used these techniques use them empirically.

Danny your motives are clearly not about being more """"encyclopaedic"""" as we have seen your methods time and time again. As the Wikipedia page says: """". . .You can quickly insert inline references to web pages by inserting a URL surrounded by single square brackets; this does not provide as much information to readers, but it is much better than not citing your sources at all"""" Interestingly, I see you have only attacked and vandalized the Quotes website, and none of the Watchtower's multiple links, no surprise there with your gross bias screaming from the rooftops. As for the links to Quotes websites, they are extremely encyclopaedic, and the 1975 page has no commentary, but lists all the printed material about 1975, so as to give fair and reasonable coverage, rather than just a few selective quotes. They are all given their source, publication, date and page numbers for proof and reference. Your apparent fear and terror that the public might actually read what the Watchtower organization has written is very revealing. You clearly have an agenda to vandalize and ban free speech when it doesn't suit your agenda, not dissimilar to your religious organisation. I suggest you look inside and see why now after many months, you feel the desperate need to hide accurate, comprehensive, dated, quotes, direct and unaltered that have been published by the Watch Tower Society? If you can give all the 1975 publications from the Watchtower's website, then I'm sure many here will be only to happy to list that link, but I think you will find they refuse to give any information to the public about their less than flattering publications, and that is where we all need to see a comprehensive and fully documented source like the excellent quotes site on 1975. You have failed to substantiate any of your claims about the quotes site; merely saying """"it's not useful"""" is a deadpan POV with no basis but your own fear of reality, and your desperate urged to manipulate the public.

Travian is sad so sad ( but he'll survive ;) no not really it all stemmed from one thing to another you will see ill try to make you understand this in a most less confusing way as possible k?. im reading it as we speak ill be on it in a few secs. < this reply is to JBW

the following is to my fellow blockee magog: 

yes you may make some suggestions my fellow gentleman D you may be happy to know that ive read them even before i joined wiki and ive read them just now just because you asked so nicely here are the replys in an orderly fashion please take the time to read it my dear sir
 
1. i understand the battleground thing was just a show of enthusiasm we'll get to that in a minute
2. now i dont have a mother(or parents for that matter) but i know where you are getting at: dont try to hurt other peoples feelings or as you may put it or potty it ;)  dont be a potty mouth
3. ( now this is the part Travian has a little problem with i feel that you should have been a wee bit more lenient with me on my first block(not this one) you should have warned me before blocking since it was my first time anyway but i guess blocking all those other vandals has some kind of a PTSD effect on wiki admins dont worry ill make the explanation short  please tolerate Travian he only made 4 reverts he was warned ONLY once for reverting 3 times and at that time he didnt check his talk page so he didnt know if he had a warning as he was busy browsing but that wasnt a violation it was a fair warning no doubt but... at that exact time i was going to modify my 4th edit(it was not a revert) so naturally i wouldnt be able to see the warning i only saw the orange message after i finished editing and saved the page after i did that i got another warning only it wasnt a warning it said that i have been reported for editting 4 times boy did i wish it was a warning though P now i felt that i deserved a warning before i got blocked a warning by YOU yourself we are all guys here arent we (even though im 12 i still do count D ) my point is we are all reasonable men here i would have stopped had i known that i was doing harm and not the good i envisioned. so please i would like to ask you tolerate me of you will ill talk more about this below
4. oh i humbly apologize but its just that that situation was unique that particular user wasnt going to listen anyway but believe me another user spoke to him giving a link to disprove his point but he kept insisting he was right i assumed good faith in that had he seen that link he would not have continued with his points (as he had been reverted by many others before too) but i was clearly wrong on that part so i reverted his edits and he kept reverting mine so i posted a comment on his talk page only to get insulted. i would have welcomed him with the """"welcome to wikipedia"""" thingy with the pretty pictures but alas i had no knowledge of how to do that. but i did make a little mistake though that comment i made may have been a bit personal but it was not an attack no was it insulting but it was accurate notheless and when he insulted me back i thought of ignoring him but knowing that he could easily be aggravated i just couldn't pass this offer up just for the giggles but i know when im guilty regardless of  reason if you may ask why i did it i would answer with IDIFTL D
5.mastodon lol thats funny(did you know scientists are running an extinct cloning program? so the mastodons might indeed be coming back) oh no no my fellow editor you got it all wrong i wasnt really angry i did it for the laughs it was funny even if it was a little bit after all creating a page with """"hairy monkey balls"""" did make me giggle P i hope someone besides me got some laughs ;) but alas i know when ive done something bad read the """"in a nutshell"""" part for details of you are confused

yes ive read them now i cant guarantee that but i promise i will not be a potty mouth k? i cannot guarantee the other part because i may accidentaly edit 4 times in a row but i want you to be a bit lenient with me on this last part now ive seen people right here on wiki who made more than 10 reverts not get immediately bloc"
